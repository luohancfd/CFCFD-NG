/++
 + ChemODEStep is an abstract class that provides the interface
 + for a chemistry ODE update step. This class provides just one
 + public service so we make that happen when the object is
 + called like a function with opCall().
 +
 + You might rightly ask "Why use a class when a function would do?"
 + It turns out that there is a lot of extra state that needs to be
 + stored and a lot of working array space. This is possible as
 + module level static data. However, it just plain looks neater
 + in a class.
