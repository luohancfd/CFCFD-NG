<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Eilmer3 implementation &mdash; background for discussion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<p>In Eilmer3, the implementation of boundary conditions accounts
for a little over 6% of the total lines of code written in C++.
In the Python code, the percentage of lines of code just dedicated
to the boundary conditions is about 10%.<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr-.1" href="#fn-.1">1</a></sup>
However, these relatively small numbers belie the amount
of effort that is spent on the boundary condition portion
of the code.
By effort, I'm talking about discussion, planning,
re-implementation, refactoring and other code development
activities that have focused on the boundary conditions.
As we move forward with Eilmer4 development, it's clear
that we've outgrown the approach we used for boundary
conditions with Eilmer3.
For Eilmer4, we would like to implement an improved design.
It's useful, therefore, to dissect the implementation in
Eilmer3 and see where and how there might be room for improvement.
</p>
<p>
In our approach to numerically solving the Navier-Stokes
equations, we separate the update of flow physics into
an update for convective processes and an update for
diffusive processes.
Thus, in terms of boundary conditions, we need to apply
the special handling at the boundary at least twice:
once for the convective update, and once for the diffusive update.
Also, what the boundary condition needs to do for the convective update
and then later for the diffusive update is not likely to be
the same for both updates.
This distinction between convective and diffusive updates
is reflected in the code implementation.
In Eilmer3, boundary conditions are implemented as
classes.
The base class is the aptly named <code>BoundaryCondition</code>.
The two workhorse public methods it provides are
<code>apply_convective()</code> and <code>apply_viscous()</code>.
These are called at the appropriate points in the code
before undertaking the convective or diffusive update.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-1"><span class="section-number-3">1.1</span> Strength of the present design</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">

<p>The present design provides a very neat entry point
into the code.
When one wants to inspect what an <b>Adiabatic</b> boundary condition
does, that is, how it is implemented, then one can
open the <code>bc_adiabatic.cxx</code> and the code is in one place.
It would probably be necessary to see where
<code>apply_convective()</code> and <code>apply_viscous()</code> are called also
to get full context.
But basically, that's it for understanding the implementation.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-2"><span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> Weaknesses of the present design</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">

<p>From a modularity standpoint, there are hints in this design
that a given boundary condition object does too much.
That hint is the fact that it applies two different behaviours
in different contexts.
What this leads to is code repetition.
Say you have a list of possible behaviours labelled
<i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, and <i>D</i> that could apply to the convective portion of the
update.
At the same time, you have behaviours <i>w</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i> that
apply to the diffusive part of the update.
The problem is that our single <code>BoundaryCondition</code> class needs to
provide the implementation for the combined behaviour of
say <i>A-w</i>, <i>A-x</i>, <i>B-w</i>, <i>B-y</i>, <i>B-z</i> and so on.
Not all combinations are valid, that is, physically reasonable
for our flow solver but you can see how the combinations
quickly multiply.
A design technique fix for this is composition.
We could decompose the <code>BoundaryCondition</code> object into
a convective flux component, and a diffusive flux component.
We'll explore this idea, or an extension of it, in the design
proposals to follow.
</p>
<p>
The other hint that the present <code>BoundaryCondition</code> object does too
much is the fact that certain classes rely on the base class
implementation.
This implies that a particular class doesn't really care
about interacting with the convective terms, or, vice versa,
doesn't really care about interacting with the diffusive terms.
(This reliance on base class implementation also
detracts from the single-point-of-entry strength mentioned above.
For these boundary conditions, the implementation is no longer in one
place, and one has to go looking elsewhere.)
</p>
<p>
Finally, although the <code>BoundaryCondition</code> object does too much,
the total implementation of boundary effects actually doesn't
do enough, or rather, there is a lack of flexibility.
We have come across a number of boundary condition behaviours
that don't fall neatly into the pattern of "apply this just now before the
convective update" and then "apply this just now before the diffusive
update".
For these cases, the code has extra switches and flags that intercept
the general behaviour based on special conditions.
These "special conditions" are related to boundary effects and
so should be treated somewhere else.
</p>

<h3 id="sec-1-3"><span class="section-number-3">1.3</span> Why it's like this</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">

<p>Rather than finish this section beating up on poor old Eilmer3,
I'd like to mention why we've outgrown this boundary condition
implementation.
The primary reason is that Eilmer's multiphysics capability
has grown.
The boundary condition implementation is a very serviceable
arrangement if you restrict yourself to a pure fluid.
However, the extension to multi-component fluids, coupled
heat transfer at the boundaries, MHD effects,
surfaces that ablate and pyrolise, moving boundaries and radiating
flow fields has put a large amount of strain on our boundary
condition implementation.
Mentioning this here also helps inform the discussion of
what we need to support in Eilmer4.
</p>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> A proposal for boundary condition implementation in Eilmer4</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">

<p>I'm going to begin by just stating the proposed implementation.
Then I'll give some arguments for and against its use.
Also, bear in mind, this first part of the design proposal concerns
the developer of the internal numerics in D.
As you read this, there might be a few WTF moments when you
think about this design as a user.
I will discuss later how the user never need know about the
internal design.
</p>
<p>
Let's summarise the limitations in the Eilmer3 design that
were getting difficult to work around:
</p><ol>
<li>the boundary conditions were only applied at two
   points in time in the code: first, in the
   convective update before reconstruction,
   and second, in the diffusive update just
   before computing spatial derivatives; and 
</li>
<li>when they were applied, they had to exert their
   effect on <i>all</i> governing equations.
</li>
</ol>

<p>Regarding point 1, this lead to a number of special cases
in the code to get certain boundary condition effects.
That number of "special" cases was growing to the
point that they weren't so special anymore.
Regarding point 2, this is what potentially leads
to requiring a combinatorial amount of boundary conditions.
We want to avoid this.
</p>
<p>
These limitations point directly to a design solution.
We need to be able to specialise the boundary condition
code is two distinct ways:
</p><ol>
<li>We need specialisation based on <i>when</i> in the code
   the boundary conditions are called.
</li>
<li>We need specialisation of action based on <i>what</i>
   flow properties are affected, or more specifically, which governing
   equations the boundary condition interacts with.
</li>
</ol>


<p>
I'll now present the proposed design for boundary conditions
as a top-down design.
Let's consider the major steps the code does in a time step:
</p><ol>
<li>Convective update
<ul>
<li>a. Reconstruction
</li>
<li>b. Convective flux calculation
</li>
<li>c. Time derivative estimate
</li>
<li>d. Cell properties update
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Diffusive update
<ul>
<li>a. Spatial derivative calculation
</li>
<li>b. Diffusive flux assembly
</li>
<li>c. Time derivative estimate
</li>
<li>d. Cell properties update
</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ol>

<p>In my current thinking, we want four points of special
boundary condition action.
Those actions are:
</p><ol>
<li>Before reconstruction (1a.), <b>set ghost cell properties.</b>
</li>
<li>After convective flux calculation (1b.), <b>intercept and possibly override certain boundary fluxes.</b>
</li>
<li>Before spatial derivative calculation (2a.), <b>set boundary interface values.</b>
</li>
<li>After diffusive dlux assembly (2b.), <b>intercept and possibly override certain boundary fluxes.</b>
</li>
</ol>


<p>
Amongst those four actions, we have three different classes of boundary condition:
</p><ol>
<li>those that set ghost cells;
</li>
<li>those that set fluxes; and
</li>
<li>those that set interface values.
</li>
</ol>

<p>So the design proposal calls for three distinct boundary conditions classes:
</p><ol>
<li><code>GhostCellBC</code>,
</li>
<li><code>FluxBC</code>, and
</li>
<li><code>InterfaceBC</code>.
</li>
</ol>

<p>These are all separate types. I can't at the moment see any reason they
would need to share a common base type.
</p>
<p>
Returning a little higher to our view on the design, each <code>Block</code> needs
to keep four lists. In each of those lists is a set of appropriate
boundary conditions to be applied in order.
The proposed four lists are:
</p><ol>
<li><code>preReconActions = [...., ...., ...]</code>;
</li>
<li><code>postConvFluxActions = [...., ...., ...., ...]</code>;
</li>
<li><code>preSpatialDerivActions = [..., ..., ..., ...]</code>; and
</li>
<li><code>postDiffFluxActions = [..., ..., ..., ...]</code>.
</li>
</ol>

<p>Why a list of actions and not just a single item?
Well this addresses our problem of combinatorial
explosion of repeated code.
I might have a boundary condition action that is only
interested in setting properties related to the
energy equation.
However, this is not enough information to specify the
complete boundary behaviour.
So in that case, I would also have to apply a boundary condition
object that gives information to satisfy the continuity
and momentum conservation equations also.
</p>
<p>
If one still wants a <code>BoundaryCondition</code> object, then it could be a
container for these items.
It would contain the four action lists, and each of those lists
has the sequence of boundary conditions to apply.
Note that a list can contain multiple actions (obviously, it's a list!)
but all the actions are the same <i>class</i> of action.<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr-.2" href="#fn-.2">2</a></sup>
So, for example, it only makes sense for the <code>preReconActions</code> to be
of type <code>GhostCellBC</code>.
If you want to set the flux at the boundary with a <code>FluxBC</code>, then put that action
in the <code>postConvFluxActions</code>.
In a similar vein, the list of <code>preSpatialDerivActions</code> will all be of
type <code>InterfaceBC</code>.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-2-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-1"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> Specialisation on <i>when</i> the boundary condition action takes place</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">

<p>Perhaps it's not necessary to belabour this point.
I'll elaborate here in any case as this document might become useful
as part of a developer guide for the code.
</p>
<p>
Referring to the list of possible boundary condition actions,
we use action 1 (pre-reconstruction event)
when it's natural for us to specify a boundary condition as ghost cells.
In this case, we don't treat the boundary interfaces as special.
Our looping machinery runs all the way out to the edge interfaces doing reconstruction
and flux calculation. Thus, the effect at the boundary is obtained by the
appropriate setting of ghost cell properties.
</p>
<p>
We use action 2 (post convective flux calculation) 
when it's more natural to set convective fluxes at
a boundary edge.
In this case, we let Eilmer do a reconstruction and flux calculation
with dummy values.<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr-.3" href="#fn-.3">3</a></sup>
After this, we intercept that dummy flux with our desired boundary flux.
</p>
<p>
Action 3 (pre spatial derivative calculation) can be used
to set certain flow properties at the interface.
These are then used when the code computes the spatial derivatives
and the diffusive fluxes that follow.
</p>
<p>
Finally, action 4 (post diffusive flux calculation) can be
used to override certain diffusive flux values after they have
been computed by the regular eilmer machinery for diffusive flux.

<h3 id="sec-2-2"><span class="section-number-3">2.2</span> Specialisation on <i>what</i> items a boundary condition affects</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">

<p>The motivation for splitting the boundary condition behaviour into
three types &mdash; ghost cell, flux and interface &mdash; is just to make
it very explicit about what behaviour a certain boundary condition 
applies.
I can't think of any easy way to guarantee that a FluxBC doesn't touch
a ghost cell value.<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr-.4" href="#fn-.4">4</a></sup>
However, by putting them in distinct classes, we can at least
prevent the placement of a <code>FluxBC</code> where a GhostCellBC is expected.

<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Discussion of the design proposal: pros and cons</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">

<p>I am biased and do favour this design.
However, I'll try to list the pros and cons as they occur to me.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-1"><span class="section-number-3">3.1</span> Pro: extensibility</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">

<p>I think this design future-proofs us (to an extent) against 
unforeseen new developments.
For example, I'm not sure that the four hook points cover all
of the points we'd like to call a boundary action in the future.
However, I think this design is extensible: we add a new hook point.
(Of course, if that balloons out to many new hook points, then
we would need to rethink how we do that.)
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-2"><span class="section-number-3">3.2</span> Pro: flexible</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">

<p>This design leverages the Unix design philosophy of building small
components that do one thing well and interact in predictable ways.
I'm advocating breaking down the boundary condition actions
into very small components that only do one or two
things and only at very specific points in time.
Complex boundary behaviour is then derived by chaining
these small actions together.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-3"><span class="section-number-3">3.3</span> Con: overly complex, difficult to debug</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">

<p>This design approach could become difficult to debug.
The developer will have to look across many pieces of
code to see who could have changed a value. I think this
can be mitigated by good coding. If a boundary condition
object has a well-defined scope, then it limits the place
one needs to look.
</p>
<p>
Also, it might become difficult for the human to reason about the code.
There's no denying that. Good design is a series of compromises.
However, I think a big part of this objection could be ameliorated
with good developer docs. Perhaps this note would be enough
to give new developers the philosophy behind this design and make
it easier to understand.<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr-.5" href="#fn-.5">5</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Finally, I appeal to Larry Wall's waterbed theory to defend the
percevied complexity in this approach.
The waterbed theory states that certain systems contain a minimum
amount of complexity. Just like a waterbed, when you try to "push
down" the complexity in one part, it "pops up" in another.
What complexities have we traded off here?
We've traded the complexity of combinatorial explosion
and ever-growing special cases with the complexity of
potentially many small objects that when linked
could look like "action at a distance."
So, we need to pick our poison.

<h3 id="sec-3-4"><span class="section-number-3">3.4</span> Con: series of actions might be put in wrong order or clobber each other</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-4">

<p>There's no safeguard to prevent a chain of actions from doing something
silly.
That being said, there's no safeguard to prevent me from doing any number
of amazingly silly things in the code.
I think this is a weak objection.
Those who develop CFD code require a highly-developed sense of
attention to detail.
If our developers have that, they'll cope with assembling
the appropriate actions in the correct order.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-5"><span class="section-number-3">3.5</span> Con: Users will be thoroughly confused.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-5">

<p>The users never need to be aware of this implementation.
If a user selects <code>SupersonicInBC</code>, this gets translated
for the D code as:
</p>


<pre class="example">  preReconActions ~= SupersonicGhostCellsBC(inflow);
  postConvFluxActions.length = 0;
  preSpatialDerivActions.length = 0;
  postDiffFluxActions.length = 0;
</pre>

<p>
The users who write user-defined boundary conditions will need
some awareness of how the boundary conditions work. That's true
of the present implementation too. There's no avoiding that.
I'm thinking of providing the following hooks:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>UserDefinedGhostCellBC</code>
</li>
<li><code>UserDefinedConvFluxBC</code>
</li>
<li><code>UserDefinedInterfaceValBC</code>
</li>
<li><code>UserDefinedDiffFluxBC</code>

Documentation will be required to explain what expectations
are associated with each of those boundary condition types.

The Python code exclusively deals with user configuration and not numerical implementation per se. 
</p><pre class="example">
echo "$(wc -l bc_defs.py)" "$(wc -l *.py | grep total)" "$(wc -l libprep3.py)" | awk '{print $1*100/($3 - $5)}'
</pre>

<p>Note that the SWIG-generated <code>libprep3.py</code> file is removed from the accounting.

<p class="footnote"><sup><a class="footnum" name="fn-.2" href="#fnr-.2">2</a></sup> At least, that's my present thinking. I can't think of why you
would need to mix and match the type of action within a list of actions.
</p>


<p class="footnote"><sup><a class="footnum" name="fn-.3" href="#fnr-.3">3</a></sup> It's probably not worth the effort of
trying to specialise the looping routines when they do <i>not</i>
need to go all the way to the edge.
There is little efficiency gain (as we are only talking about edge interfaces)
and only added complexity.
An objection to this approach might be that the dummy values cause issues
for the reconstructor (or more likely the thermo calls in the reconstructor).
My suggestion would be to set the ghost cells with valid dummy values
for all time.
For example, take the initial condition for the nearest interior cell and
keep that state constant in the ghost cells.
The assumption is that the initial condition is valid in a thermodynamic sense.
</p>


<p class="footnote"><sup><a class="footnum" name="fn-.4" href="#fnr-.4">4</a></sup> Well, we could only pass a list of interfaces to the <code>FluxBC</code> object.
However, I think that will be overly restrictive and prevent
access to some information that the <code>FluxBC</code> might reasonably need.
</p>


<p class="footnote"><sup><a class="footnum" name="fn-.5" href="#fnr-.5">5</a></sup> In the future, there will be an editor that makes this point
moot. I don't know who is going to build it or when it will be
ready. The sufficiently awesome editor would be able to expand all
our method calls and function calls at the point in the code
where we use them and in proper context. (So this editor would have to
be a half-implemented compiler.) Much like using org mode, I would be able
to hover my cursor over a function, hit SHIFT+tab and have that
function unfold in place.
