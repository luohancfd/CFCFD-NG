1. Installation
---------------
On RedHat/Fedora, the PostgreSQL server is readily available.  If it
is already installed (via RPM) then a database cluster already exists
as does the user "postgres" and the group "postgres".  The cluster
files are in /var/lib/pgsql (on Fedora).

Add a PostgreSQL user (who is allowed to make databases) with the commands:
$ su -u postgres createuser peterj
Answer "y" to the questions about allowing the new user to create databases
and other users.

Add the Apache web server as a user with read privileges.
$ su -u postgres creatuser apache
Again, answer "y" to the questions about allowing the new user to 
create databases and other users.


2. Database Management
----------------------
Now, as user peterj, we can manage the database.  First, create the
database for MONC data:
$ createdb moncdata

Gather the shot description data for the T4 facility:
$ ~/cfcfd/code/tds/database/makeSQLtable.tcl T4 /home/moncdata all -createcmd
Note that this Tcl script needs the Tcl interpreter and tcllib installed.

And, insert it into the database:
$ cd ~/work/moncdata/T4/
$ psql moncdata < shot_descriptions.sql

For future passes, we can eliminate already inserted shot descriptions
by gathering their identities into the file current_data.txt in
/home/moncdata/T4/
$ ~/cfcfd/code/tds/getCurrentData.tcl T4 /home/moncdata
Run the scanning script again and insert the new shot descriptions, if any.
$ ~/cfcfd/code/tds/database/makeSQLtable.tcl T4 /home/moncdata all
$ cd /home/moncdata/T4/
$ psql moncdata < shot_descriptions.sql

Shot descriptions for other facility names can be added to the same
database because the facility_name is a field within each record.

To remove the database, use the command:
$ dropdb moncdata


3. Database Access
------------------
To access the database, one may use the interactive terminal program:
$ psql
> \d shot_descriptions
> select * from shot_descriptions;
> select basic_file_name, project from shot_descriptions;


4. Web Access
-------------
This is provided by Soo Fern Chong (fourth-year thesis 2004) as a set of
