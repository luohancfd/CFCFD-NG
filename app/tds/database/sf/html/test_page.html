This database is essentially a mini hypersonics library.  It contains hypersonics references which are held on a shelf in room 207 in the Mechanical Engineering building.  The papers are contained in blue boxes each labelled with the primary area of research pertaining to the article on the front of the box.  The papers are there to be borrowed, photocopied and RETURNED.  If you borrow a paper can you please fill in the book on top of the cabinet and then bring it back as quick as possible.  If people don't return papers I shall have to chase them down and beat them with a stick. <br><br>

A search for a specific paper or a general field can be made by entering text in the search box above.  This searches through all the fields in the database.  e.g. if you are looking for an author by the name of Smith just type "Smith" in or if you wish to look for papers about expansion tubes just type "expansion tubes" <br><br>

If you wish to dump a bibtex file of all the entries or just a specific search, at the bottom of the page with the list of entries will be an option to do this.  <br><br>

If you have any references you have order in and you think other people may find them useful please photocopy an extra version for the database.  To keep consistency and order with the entries please bring the copy to Michael Scott (Rm 45-215) to add.  Thanks.    <br><br>
