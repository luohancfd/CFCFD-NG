<H3><A NAME="intro">Introduction</A></H3>
<P> 
The shock tunnel database is a collection of all the information stored in the
run description text files.  
This information can then be queried and searched through
the use of the MySQL database server.  
This document will describe the basic structure of a MySQL query.
</P>

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="user_ops">Commands required from the user to add information to the database</A></H3>
<UL> 
    <LI> Obtain all shots already in the database:  <br>
         <code>prompt> mysql -t -e 'select Run_ID from test_data_X3' test > \</code><br>
         <code>        /home/moncdata/databaseScripts/currentShots.txt</code> </LI>
    <LI> Run the searchForNewData.tcl script:<br>
         <code>prompt> ./searchForNewData.tcl </code><br>
	 with required arguments, specified below or when typing in the command 
	 without any arguments. </LI>
    <LI> Import shots into the database:<br>
         <code>prompt> mysqlimport --local test test_data_X3.txt</code><br>
	 Note that this command must be typed in the directory of the text file.
	 By default, this would be, for X3, <code>/home/moncdata/X3/</code></LI>
    <LI> Delete null rows in database: Go into MySQL with the command: <code>mysql</code>.
         Then, at the MySQL prompt, type the following: <br>
	 <code>mysql> use test</code> <br>
	 <code>mysql> delete from test_data_T4 where Notes is NULL and Run_ID is null</code>
	 </LI> 
</UL>

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="plan">Basic plan of my script that stores information in the
   database</A></H3>
<P> 
Firstly the user must create a text file containing a list of all the shots currently stored in the database.  
This is perfomed by the command (as an example I imagine I am using X3)<br>
<code>prompt> mysql -t -e 'select Run_ID from test_data_X3' test > \</code><br>
<code>        /home/moncdata/databaseScripts/currentData.txt</code><br>  
The user can then execute the script by typing in the command
<code>./searchForNewData.tcl</code> in the directory that this file is located in.
By default this directory is <code>/$HOME/databaseScripts/</code>.  
This command takes a few arguements to execute.  
The amount of new data to be added to the database (either 1 or all), 
the name of the shocktube (ie T4, X3 ...), 
the directory where the shot/s is/are located and, 
if 1 file was selected, the name of the shot.
An overview of these arguments is given if the command is executed without any arguments.
</P>
<P>
The search procedure firstly creates the text file 
<code>mysqldata_&lt;<em>tube_name</em>&gt;.txt</code> if it hasn't
already been created.
The program will then search through all the files in the specify
directory looking for shot number directories.
Each shot number found is then compared to the shot number IDs in the
file <code>currentData.txt</code>.
If the shot number is not in the database, it will add the shot's
information into the <code>test_data_X3.txt</code> file.
Each column of information is separated by a tab and their
positions coincide with their respective column names in the database.  
The program will then add the new information to the database through
the command: <br>
<code>mysqlimport --local test test_data_X3.txt</code><br>
If the program finds that there are new columns not yet in the
database the user will be prompted to view the maintenance problems
text file for more details.
</P>

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="original_database">A description of the original database state</A></H3>
<P> 
A description of the current database can be obtained by typing the commands:<br>
<code>USE <I>database</I>;</code><br>
<code>SHOW TABLES;</code><br>
To find information specifically relating to a certain table, 
the following command can be used:<br>
<code>DESCRIBE <I>table</I>;</code><br>
This will output all the column names of the table along with there attributes 
(e.g. data type, not null/null...).
In the original set up the database was test with a table for each tube: 
test_data_T4, test_data_X3, test_data_X2 ... 
Originally for T4, the table contained the following columns: <BR> 
<code>Project (text), Run_ID (text),
Date (date), Blame (text), Reservoir (text), Driver (text), Diaphragm (text),
Shocktube (text), Nozzle (text), Acceln_tube (text), Jackoff (text), Bridge (text), 
Evac_Press (text), Piston (text), Pressure (text), Electron (text), Skimmers (text), 
Condition (text), Notes (text)</code>.<BR>
Originally for X3: <BR>
<code>Project (text), Run_ID (text),
Date (date), Blame (text), Reservoir (text), Driver (text), 2nd_Driver (text), Diaphragm_1 (text),
Diaphragm_2 (text), Diaphragm_3 (text), Shocktube (text), Nozzle (text), Acceln_tube (text), Piston (text), 
1st_Driven (text), Notes (text)</code>.
</P>

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="query">Structure of a MySQL query with examples</A></H3>
<P>
In the following description, words in capital letters indicate a
MySQL command but don't need to be in capitals when constructing a
query.
Words in italics indicate that the word needs to be substituted with
the name of the database, table, column, etc...

The MySQL database program can be loaded up by simply typing <code>mysql</code>. 
All of the following queries will assume that the user is in MySQL.  
The first command that needs to be type is <br>
<code>USE <I>database</I>;</code><br>
The database I have used so far is <code>test</code>. 
The queries can also be used from a command prompt.  
A command prompt query is just in the following form: <br>
<code>mysql -e '<I>normal-MySQL-select-query</I>' <I>database</I></code><br>
An example of this will be given for the first query. 
</P>

The basic form of a select query is as follows:<BR> 
<code>SELECT <em>Arguments1</em> FROM <em>Arguments2</em>;</code><br>
<em>Arguments1</em> consists of the data fields / columns (eg Project, Date, etc) 
of the table that the user wishes to view.<br>  
If the user wishes to view all the data, * can be used for <em>Arguments1</em>.  
<em>Arguments2</em> is the table/s from where the data is to be selected. 
In this case there is only one table and that is data.  
Following the <code>FROM</code> statement can be commands to select 
more specific information.  
These commands include:<BR>
<UL>
<LI> <code>WHERE</code> is used to select specific rows, or rows having a value 
     greater than / less than a certain value.
     For example:
     <code>SELECT * FROM <I>table</I> WHERE Run_ID = 7319;</code> <BR>
     From the command prompt this would be specified as:<br> 
     <code>prompt> mysql -e 'SELECT * FROM <I>table</I> WHERE Run_ID = 7319' <I>database</I></code> <BR>
     Example:<br>
     <code>SELECT * FROM tubes WHERE Diaphragm > 3 and Diaphragm < 6;</code></LI>
<LI> <code>WHERE .... LIKE</code> is used to select specific rows that contain 
     certain information.  
     Eg If the user wishes to find which Drivers used 35% Argon the query would be:
     SELECT * FROM tubes WHERE Driver LIKE "%35_Ar%" OR Driver LIKE "%35__Ar%";  
     The % sign is a symbol that represents any number of characters 
     and the _ is a symbol that represents one character.
     Both the one _ and the two __ need to be used as
     sometimes the data is stored 35%Ar and sometimes 35% Ar.<BR>
     If you then wanted to find out specifically what projects used this driver.  
     The following query could be used:<BR>
     <code>SELECT Project FROM tubes WHERE Driver LIKE "%35_Ar%" OR Driver LIKE "%35__Ar%" GROUP BY Project;</code></LI>
<LI> <code>GROUP BY</code> - This command is used to group duplicate fields together.  
     For example, if the user just wanted to view the titles of all 
     the different projects:<BR>
     <code>SELECT Project FROM data GROUP BY Project;</code></LI>
<LI> <code>ORDER BY</code> - used to order the data into either ascending 
     or descending order.
     The results can also be ordered by more than one column.<BR> 
     For example, to order by Run_ID: <br>
     <code>SELECT * FROM <I>table</I> ORDER BY Run_ID;</code><BR>
     or to reverse the order: <br>
     <code>SELECT * FROM <I>table</I> ORDER BY Run_ID desc;</code></LI>
</UL>

<P> 
Some more examples with links to web documentation about the commands.
<UL>
<LI> Select everything from <I>table</I>: <br>
     <code>SELECT * FROM <I>table</I>;</code><br>
     This can also be done from a command prompt in the standard shell: <br>

<LI> Select data with diaphragm thickness greater than 3mm:</br>
     <code>SELECT * FROM data WHERE Diaphragm > 3; </code></LI>
<LI> Select Project, Run_ID and Acceleration Tube for only those project that

<H3><A NAME="notes">Notes on getting maximum information into the database </A></H3>
<UL> 
<LI> Keep the amount of non-essential folders in the individual tube directories 
     to a minimum.  
     This prevents the script from trying to find information in folders that aren't relevate.</LI>
<LI> If new data fields are going to be added to the run description file, 
     please make sure there is at least 2 full stops between the data name 
     and the data information.  
     This is so the program can find the new data fields.</LI>
<LI> The date in the run description file needs to able to be converted to a format that
     MySQL can recognise.  
     This means that the date in these files can be written in the
     following formats: dd/mm/yy, dd/mm/yyyy, dd month (eg Jan or January etc) yy, or
     dd month (eg Jan or January etc) yyyy.  
     Any other format and the date won't be converted to a format that MySQL recognises.</LI>
<LI> Keep all the different data fields (eg Project, Date, Blame, etc....) on different lines</LI>
<LI> Making sure the shot folder, the <em>mod</em> file and <em>text</em> file have the same name. 
     In the case of X2, Run can still be added to the front of the text file if you wish.</LI>
<LI> At the moment, due to the data I had received the X2 run description files had RUN 
     (in capitals) at the front of them.
     If this changes to Run for example, this would also need to be changed in the 
     <code>X2RunAndModNames</code> procedure.</LI>

<H3><A NAME="add">Possible additions/improvements to Tcl script</A></H3>
<P> 
Here are some possible improvements the could be added to the Tcl script:
<UL>
    <LI> Automate the MySQL interaction with Tcl.
         This would mean that the user would not need
         to type in the two mysql commands. </LI>
    <LI> Automate adding a new column to the database rather than having to change code.</LI>
    <LI> Adding the ability to search for &gt; and &lt; a value for the Driver data.</LI>
    <LI> Using a graphical user interface with the MySQL results and queries.</LI>
    <LI> Adding the descript mod file information into the database.</LI>
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="my_over_pos">Why MySQL was chosen over PostgreSQL</A></H3>
<P> 
MySQL was chosen over PostgreSQL due to MySQL being very easy to use, extensive
online documentation and very easy to download and install.  
PostGreSQL seems to be more powerful and have more options than MySQL.  
However, most of its advantages seem to relate to the use of more complex relational databases.  
Because run description database contains only the one table, this power and further
complexity was not required.
</P>

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="get_mysql">Where to download and how to install MySQL</A></H3>
<P> 
MySQL can be download from the 
<A HREF="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql-3.23.html">MySQL official site</A>. 
I installed the <code>rpm</code> packages and so will give some intructions on how to do that.  
Firstly, both the MySQL 3.23.47 Server (i386) and MySQL 3.23.47 Client
programs (i386) files need to be downloaded.  
Then at the command shell prompt type:<br>
<code>shell> rpm -i MySQL-3.23.47.i386.rpm MySQL-client-3.23.47.i386.rpm</code></br>
When I installed the program the command that worked for me is slightly
different to what the MySQL website suggests.  
At the shell prompt I typed:<br>
<code>shell> mysql_install_db</code><br>
This is all that I was required to do to install the program.  
If this doesn't work, have a look at the 
<A HREF="http://www.mysql.com/doc/P/o/Post-installation.html">
     MySQL Post-installation Setup and Testing Page</A>.
For any further questions, the MySQL website has extensive, searchable 
<A HREF="http://www.mysql.com/doc/">online documentation</A>
that may be useful.
