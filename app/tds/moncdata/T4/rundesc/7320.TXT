Pitot probe only in test section.  Off centre-line. 
Estimate recoil to be 100 mm.  Probe is 100 mm downstream of exit plane 
before recoil. 

Acceleration sensor measuring acceleration of dancefloor:
on PCB Charge amp (M3994) at 0.49 pC/unit and 100 unit/V.
Accelerometer sens is 49 pC/g.  Thus we have 1 V/g.
