<h1><a href="#Overview" name="Overview"><p>Overview</a></h1>

<p>GNU Wget is a free utility for non-interactive download of files from
the Web.  It supports HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols, as well as
retrieval through HTTP proxies.

<p>This chapter is a partial overview of Wget's features.


<ul>
<li>Wget is non-interactive, meaning that it can work in the
     background, while the user is not logged on.  This allows you to
     start a retrieval and disconnect from the system, letting Wget
     finish the work.  By contrast, most of the Web browsers require
     constant user's presence, which can be a great hindrance when
     transferring a lot of data.

<li>Wget can follow links in HTML pages and create local versions of
     remote web sites, fully recreating the directory structure of the
     original site.  This is sometimes referred to as "recursive
     downloading."  While doing that, Wget respects the Robot Exclusion
     Standard (<code>/robots.txt</code>).  Wget can be instructed to convert the
     links in downloaded HTML files to the local files for offline
     viewing.

<li>File name wildcard matching and recursive mirroring of directories
     are available when retrieving via FTP.  Wget can read the
     time-stamp information given by both HTTP and FTP servers, and
     store it locally.  Thus Wget can see if the remote file has
     changed since last retrieval, and automatically retrieve the new
     version if it has.  This makes Wget suitable for mirroring of FTP
     sites, as well as home pages.

<li>Wget has been designed for robustness over slow or unstable network
     connections; if a download fails due to a network problem, it will
     keep retrying until the whole file has been retrieved.  If the
     server supports regetting, it will instruct the server to continue
     the download from where it left off.

<li>Wget supports proxy servers, which can lighten the network load,
     speed up retrieval and provide access behind firewalls.  However,
     if you are behind a firewall that requires that you use a socks
     style gateway, you can get the socks library and build Wget with
     support for socks.  Wget also supports the passive FTP downloading
     as an option.

<li>Builtin features offer mechanisms to tune which links you wish to
     follow (see <a href="#Following_Links">Following Links</a>.).

<li>The retrieval is conveniently traced with printing dots, each dot
     representing a fixed amount of data received (1KB by default).
     These representations can be customized to your preferences.

<li>Most of the features are fully configurable, either through
     command line options, or via the initialization file <code>.wgetrc</code> (see <a
     href="#Startup_File">Startup File</a>.).  Wget allows you to define
     <dfn>global</dfn> startup files (<code>/usr/local/etc/wgetrc</code> by default) for
     site settings.

<li>Finally, GNU Wget is free software.  This means that everyone may
     use it, redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the
     GNU General Public License, as published by the Free Software
     Foundation (see <a href="#Copying">Copying</a>.).  
</ul>

<h1><a href="#Invoking" name="Invoking"><p>Invoking</a></h1>

<p>By default, Wget is very simple to invoke.  The basic syntax is:

<pre>
<p>wget [<var>option</var>]... [<var>URL</var>]...
</pre>

<p>Wget will simply download all the URLs specified on the command
line.  <var>URL</var> is a <dfn>Uniform Resource Locator</dfn>, as defined below.

<p>However, you may wish to change some of the default parameters of
Wget.  You can do it two ways: permanently, adding the appropriate
command to <code>.wgetrc</code> (see <a href="#Startup_File">Startup File</a>.), or specifying it on the command
line.

<h2><a href="#URL_Format" name="URL_Format"><p>URL Format</a></h2>

<dfn><p>URL</dfn> is an acronym for Uniform Resource Locator.  A uniform resource
locator is a compact string representation for a resource available via
the Internet.  Wget recognizes the URL syntax as per RFC1738.  This is
the most widely used form (square brackets denote optional parts):

<pre>
<p>http://host[:port]/directory/file
ftp://host[:port]/directory/file
</pre>

<p>You can also encode your username and password within a URL:

<pre>
<p>ftp://user:password@host/path
http://user:password@host/path
</pre>

<p>Either <var>user</var> or <var>password</var>, or both, may be left out.  If you leave out
either the HTTP username or password, no authentication will be sent.
If you leave out the FTP username, <code>anonymous</code> will be used.  If you
leave out the FTP password, your email address will be supplied as a
default password.(1)

<p>You can encode unsafe characters in a URL as <code>%xy</code>, <code>xy</code> being the
hexadecimal representation of the character's ASCII value.  Some common
unsafe characters include <code>%</code> (quoted as <code>%25</code>), <code>:</code> (quoted as <code>%3A</code>), and <code>@</code>
(quoted as <code>%40</code>).  Refer to RFC1738 for a comprehensive list of unsafe
characters.

<p>Wget also supports the <code>type</code> feature for FTP URLs.  By default, FTP
documents are retrieved in the binary mode (type <code>i</code>), which means that
they are downloaded unchanged.  Another useful mode is the <code>a</code> (<dfn>ASCII</dfn>)
mode, which converts the line delimiters between the different
operating systems, and is thus useful for text files.  Here is an
example:

<pre>
<p>ftp://host/directory/file;type=a
</pre>

<p>Two alternative variants of URL specification are also supported,
because of historical (hysterical?) reasons and their widespreaded use.

<p>FTP-only syntax (supported by <code>NcFTP</code>):
<pre>
<p>host:/dir/file
</pre>

<p>HTTP-only syntax (introduced by <code>Netscape</code>):
<pre>
<p>host[:port]/dir/file
</pre>

<p>These two alternative forms are deprecated, and may cease being
supported in the future.

<p>If you do not understand the difference between these notations, or
do not know which one to use, just use the plain ordinary format you use
with your favorite browser, like <code>Lynx</code> or <code>Netscape</code>.

<p>---------- Footnotes ----------

<p><p>(1) If you have a <code>.netrc</code> file in your home directory, password will
also be searched for there.

<h2><a href="#Option_Syntax" name="Option_Syntax"><p>Option Syntax</a></h2>

<p>Since Wget uses GNU getopts to process its arguments, every option
has a short form and a long form.  Long options are more convenient to
remember, but take time to type.  You may freely mix different option
styles, or specify options after the command-line arguments.  Thus you
may write:

<pre>
<p>wget -r --tries=10 http://fly.srk.fer.hr/ -o log
</pre>

<p>The space between the option accepting an argument and the argument
may be omitted.  Instead <code>-o log</code> you can write <code>-olog</code>.

<p>You may put several options that do not require arguments together,
like:

<pre>
<p>wget -drc <var>URL</var>
</pre>

<p>This is a complete equivalent of:

<pre>
<p>wget -d -r -c <var>URL</var>
</pre>

<p>Since the options can be specified after the arguments, you may
terminate them with <code>--</code>.  So the following will try to download URL <code>-x</code>,
reporting failure to <code>log</code>:

<pre>
<p>wget -o log -- -x
</pre>

<p>The options that accept comma-separated lists all respect the
convention that specifying an empty list clears its value.  This can be
useful to clear the <code>.wgetrc</code> settings.  For instance, if your <code>.wgetrc</code>
sets <code>exclude_directories</code> to <code>/cgi-bin</code>, the following example will first
reset it, and then set it to exclude <code>/~nobody</code> and <code>/~somebody</code>.  You can
also clear the lists in <code>.wgetrc</code> (see <a href="#Wgetrc_Syntax">Wgetrc Syntax</a>.).

<pre>
<p>wget -X '' -X /~nobody,/~somebody
</pre>

<h2><a href="#Basic_Startup_Options" name="Basic_Startup_Options"><p>Basic Startup Options</a></h2>


<dl>
<dt><code>-V</code>
<dd><dt><code>--version</code>
<dd>Display the version of Wget.

<dt><code>-h</code>
<dd><dt><code>--help</code>
<dd>Print a help message describing all of Wget's command-line options.

<dt><code>-b</code>
<dd><dt><code>--background</code>
<dd>Go to background immediately after startup.  If no output file is
     specified via the <code>-o</code>, output is redirected to <code>wget-log</code>.

<dt><code>-e <var>command</var></code>
<dd><dt><code>--execute <var>command</var></code>
<dd>Execute <var>command</var> as if it were a part of <code>.wgetrc</code> (see <a href="#Startup_File">Startup
     File</a>.).  A command thus invoked will be executed <em>after</em> the
     commands in <code>.wgetrc</code>, thus taking precedence over them.  
</dl>

<h2><a href="#Logging_and_Input_File_Options" name="Logging_and_Input_File_Options"><p>Logging and Input File Options</a></h2>


<dl>
<dt><code>-o <var>logfile</var></code>
<dd><dt><code>--output-file=<var>logfile</var></code>
<dd>Log all messages to <var>logfile</var>.  The messages are normally reported
     to standard error.

<dt><code>-a <var>logfile</var></code>
<dd><dt><code>--append-output=<var>logfile</var></code>
<dd>Append to <var>logfile</var>.  This is the same as <code>-o</code>, only it appends to
     <var>logfile</var> instead of overwriting the old log file.  If <var>logfile</var>
     does not exist, a new file is created.

<dt><code>-d</code>
<dd><dt><code>--debug</code>
<dd>Turn on debug output, meaning various information important to the
     developers of Wget if it does not work properly.  Your system
     administrator may have chosen to compile Wget without debug
     support, in which case <code>-d</code> will not work.  Please note that
     compiling with debug support is always safe--Wget compiled with
     the debug support will <em>not</em> print any debug info unless requested
     with <code>-d</code>.  See <a href="#Reporting_Bugs">Reporting Bugs</a>, for more information on how to use
     <code>-d</code> for sending bug reports.

<dt><code>-q</code>
<dd><dt><code>--quiet</code>
<dd>Turn off Wget's output.

<dt><code>-v</code>
<dd><dt><code>--verbose</code>
<dd>Turn on verbose output, with all the available data.  The default
     output is verbose.

<dt><code>-nv</code>
<dd><dt><code>--non-verbose</code>
<dd>Non-verbose output--turn off verbose without being completely quiet
     (use <code>-q</code> for that), which means that error messages and basic
     information still get printed.

<dt><code>-i <var>file</var></code>
<dd><dt><code>--input-file=<var>file</var></code>
<dd>Read URLs from <var>file</var>, in which case no URLs need to be on the
     command line.  If there are URLs both on the command line and in
     an input file, those on the command lines will be the first ones to
     be retrieved.  The <var>file</var> need not be an HTML document (but no harm
     if it is)--it is enough if the URLs are just listed sequentially.

<p>However, if you specify <code>--force-html</code>, the document will be
     regarded as <code>html</code>.  In that case you may have problems with
     relative links, which you can solve either by adding <code>&lt;base
     href="<var>url</var>"&gt;</code> to the documents or by specifying <code>--base=<var>url</var></code> on
     the command line.

<dt><code>-F</code>
<dd><dt><code>--force-html</code>
<dd>When input is read from a file, force it to be treated as an HTML
     file.  This enables you to retrieve relative links from existing
     HTML files on your local disk, by adding <code>&lt;base href="<var>url</var>"&gt;</code> to
     HTML, or using the <code>--base</code> command-line option.

<dt><code>-B <var>URL</var></code>
<dd><dt><code>--base=<var>URL</var></code>
<dd>When used in conjunction with <code>-F</code>, prepends <var>URL</var> to relative links
     in the file specified by <code>-i</code>.  
</dl>

<h2><a href="#Download_Options" name="Download_Options"><p>Download Options</a></h2>


<dl>
<dt><code>--bind-address=<var>ADDRESS</var></code>
<dd>When making client TCP/IP connections, <code>bind()</code> to <var>ADDRESS</var> on the
     local machine.  <var>ADDRESS</var> may be specified as a hostname or IP
     address.  This option can be useful if your machine is bound to
     multiple IPs.

<dt><code>-t <var>number</var></code>
<dd><dt><code>--tries=<var>number</var></code>
<dd>Set number of retries to <var>number</var>.  Specify 0 or <code>inf</code> for infinite
     retrying.

<dt><code>-O <var>file</var></code>
<dd><dt><code>--output-document=<var>file</var></code>
<dd>The documents will not be written to the appropriate files, but
     all will be concatenated together and written to <var>file</var>.  If <var>file</var>
     already exists, it will be overwritten.  If the <var>file</var> is <code>-</code>, the
     documents will be written to standard output.  Including this
     option automatically sets the number of tries to 1.

<dt><code>-nc</code>
<dd><dt><code>--no-clobber</code>
<dd>If a file is downloaded more than once in the same directory,
     Wget's behavior depends on a few options, including <code>-nc</code>.  In
     certain cases, the local file will be <dfn>clobbered</dfn>, or overwritten,
     upon repeated download.  In other cases it will be preserved.

<p>When running Wget without <code>-N</code>, <code>-nc</code>, or <code>-r</code>, downloading the same
     file in the same directory will result in the original copy of
     <var>file</var> being preserved and the second copy being named
     <code><var>file</var>.1</code>.  If that file is downloaded yet again, the
     third copy will be named <code><var>file</var>.2</code>, and so on.  When <code>-nc</code> is
     specified, this behavior is suppressed, and Wget will refuse to
     download newer copies of <code><var>file</var></code>.  Therefore, "<code>no-clobber</code>" is
     actually a misnomer in this mode--it's not clobbering that's
     prevented (as the numeric suffixes were already preventing
     clobbering), but rather the multiple version saving that's
     prevented.

<p>When running Wget with <code>-r</code>, but without <code>-N</code> or <code>-nc</code>, re-downloading a
     file will result in the new copy simply overwriting the old.
     Adding <code>-nc</code> will prevent this behavior, instead causing the
     original version to be preserved and any newer copies on the
     server to be ignored.

<p>When running Wget with <code>-N</code>, with or without <code>-r</code>, the decision as to
     whether or not to download a newer copy of a file depends on the
     local and remote timestamp and size of the file (see <a
     href="#Time_Stamping">Time-Stamping</a>.).  <code>-nc</code> may not be
     specified at the same time as <code>-N</code>.

<p>Note that when <code>-nc</code> is specified, files with the suffixes <code>.html</code> or
     (yuck) <code>.htm</code> will be loaded from the local disk and parsed as if
     they had been retrieved from the Web.

<dt><code>-c</code>
<dd><dt><code>--continue</code>
<dd>Continue getting a partially-downloaded file.  This is useful when
     you want to finish up a download started by a previous instance of
     Wget, or by another program.  For instance:

<pre>
<p>wget -c ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/ls-lR.Z
</pre>

<p>If there is a file named <code>ls-lR.Z</code> in the current directory, Wget
     will assume that it is the first portion of the remote file, and
     will ask the server to continue the retrieval from an offset equal
     to the length of the local file.

<p>Note that you don't need to specify this option if you just want
     the current invocation of Wget to retry downloading a file should
     the connection be lost midway through.  This is the default
     behavior.  <code>-c</code> only affects resumption of downloads started <em>prior</em> to
     this invocation of Wget, and whose local files are still sitting
     around.

<p>Without <code>-c</code>, the previous example would just download the remote
     file to <code>ls-lR.Z.1</code>, leaving the truncated <code>ls-lR.Z</code> file alone.

<p>Beginning with Wget 1.7, if you use <code>-c</code> on a non-empty file, and it
     turns out that the server does not support continued downloading,
     Wget will refuse to start the download from scratch, which would
     effectively ruin existing contents.  If you really want the
     download to start from scratch, remove the file.

<p>Also beginning with Wget 1.7, if you use <code>-c</code> on a file which is of
     equal size as the one on the server, Wget will refuse to download
     the file and print an explanatory message.  The same happens when
     the file is smaller on the server than locally (presumably because
     it was changed on the server since your last download
     attempt)--because "continuing" is not meaningful, no download
     occurs.

<p>On the other side of the coin, while using <code>-c</code>, any file that's
     bigger on the server than locally will be considered an incomplete
     download and only <code>(length(remote) - length(local))</code> bytes will be
     downloaded and tacked onto the end of the local file.  This
     behavior can be desirable in certain cases--for instance, you can
     use <code>wget -c</code> to download just the new portion that's been appended
     to a data collection or log file.

<p>However, if the file is bigger on the server because it's been
     <em>changed</em>, as opposed to just <em>appended</em> to, you'll end up with a
     garbled file.  Wget has no way of verifying that the local file is
     really a valid prefix of the remote file.  You need to be
     especially careful of this when using <code>-c</code> in conjunction with <code>-r</code>,
     since every file will be considered as an "incomplete download"
     candidate.

<p>Another instance where you'll get a garbled file if you try to use
     <code>-c</code> is if you have a lame HTTP proxy that inserts a "transfer
     interrupted" string into the local file.  In the future a
     "rollback" option may be added to deal with this case.

<p>Note that <code>-c</code> only works with FTP servers and with HTTP servers
     that support the <code>Range</code> header.

<dt><code>--progress=<var>type</var></code>
<dd>Select the type of the progress indicator you wish to use.  Legal
     indicators are "dot" and "bar".

<p>The "dot" indicator is used by default.  It traces the retrieval by
     printing dots on the screen, each dot representing a fixed amount
     of downloaded data.

<p>When using the dotted retrieval, you may also set the <dfn>style</dfn> by
     specifying the type as <code>dot:<var>style</var></code>.  Different styles assign
     different meaning to one dot.  With the <code>default</code> style each dot
     represents 1K, there are ten dots in a cluster and 50 dots in a
     line.  The <code>binary</code> style has a more "computer"-like orientation--8K
     dots, 16-dots clusters and 48 dots per line (which makes for 384K
     lines).  The <code>mega</code> style is suitable for downloading very large
     files--each dot represents 64K retrieved, there are eight dots in a
     cluster, and 48 dots on each line (so each line contains 3M).

<p>Specifying <code>--progress=bar</code> will draw a nice ASCII progress bar
     graphics (a.k.a "thermometer" display) to indicate retrieval.  If
     the output is not a TTY, this option will be ignored, and Wget
     will revert to the dot indicator.  If you want to force the bar
     indicator, use <code>--progress=bar:force</code>.

<dt><code>-N</code>
<dd><dt><code>--timestamping</code>
<dd>Turn on time-stamping.  See <a href="#Time_Stamping">Time-Stamping</a>, for details.

<dt><code>-S</code>
<dd><dt><code>--server-response</code>
<dd>Print the headers sent by HTTP servers and responses sent by FTP
     servers.

<dt><code>--spider</code>
<dd>When invoked with this option, Wget will behave as a Web <dfn>spider</dfn>,
     which means that it will not download the pages, just check that
     they are there.  You can use it to check your bookmarks, e.g. with:

<pre>
<p>wget --spider --force-html -i bookmarks.html
</pre>

<p>This feature needs much more work for Wget to get close to the
     functionality of real WWW spiders.

<dt><code>-T seconds</code>
<dd><dt><code>--timeout=<var>seconds</var></code>
<dd>Set the read timeout to <var>seconds</var> seconds.  Whenever a network read
     is issued, the file descriptor is checked for a timeout, which
     could otherwise leave a pending connection (uninterrupted read).
     The default timeout is 900 seconds (fifteen minutes).  Setting
     timeout to 0 will disable checking for timeouts.

<p>Please do not lower the default timeout value with this option
     unless you know what you are doing.

<dt><code>-w <var>seconds</var></code>
<dd><dt><code>--wait=<var>seconds</var></code>
<dd>Wait the specified number of seconds between the retrievals.  Use
     of this option is recommended, as it lightens the server load by
     making the requests less frequent.  Instead of in seconds, the
     time can be specified in minutes using the <code>m</code> suffix, in hours
     using <code>h</code> suffix, or in days using <code>d</code> suffix.

<p>Specifying a large value for this option is useful if the network
     or the destination host is down, so that Wget can wait long enough
     to reasonably expect the network error to be fixed before the
     retry.

<dt><code>--waitretry=<var>seconds</var></code>
<dd>If you don't want Wget to wait between <em>every</em> retrieval, but only
     between retries of failed downloads, you can use this option.
     Wget will use <dfn>linear backoff</dfn>, waiting 1 second after the first
     failure on a given file, then waiting 2 seconds after the second
     failure on that file, up to the maximum number of <var>seconds</var> you
     specify.  Therefore, a value of 10 will actually make Wget wait up
     to (1 + 2 + ... + 10) = 55 seconds per file.

<p>Note that this option is turned on by default in the global <code>wgetrc</code>
     file.

<dt><code>--random-wait</code>
<dd>Some web sites may perform log analysis to identify retrieval
     programs such as Wget by looking for statistically significant
     similarities in the time between requests. This option causes the
     time between requests to vary between 0 and 2 * <var>wait</var> seconds,
     where <var>wait</var> was specified using the <code>-w</code> or <code>--wait</code> options, in order
     to mask Wget's presence from such analysis.

<p>A recent article in a publication devoted to development on a
     popular consumer platform provided code to perform this analysis
     on the fly.  Its author suggested blocking at the class C address
     level to ensure automated retrieval programs were blocked despite
     changing DHCP-supplied addresses.

<p>The <code>--random-wait</code> option was inspired by this ill-advised
     recommendation to block many unrelated users from a web site due
     to the actions of one.

<dt><code>-Y on/off</code>
<dd><dt><code>--proxy=on/off</code>
<dd>Turn proxy support on or off.  The proxy is on by default if the
     appropriate environmental variable is defined.

<dt><code>-Q <var>quota</var></code>
<dd><dt><code>--quota=<var>quota</var></code>
<dd>Specify download quota for automatic retrievals.  The value can be
     specified in bytes (default), kilobytes (with <code>k</code> suffix), or
     megabytes (with <code>m</code> suffix).

<p>Note that quota will never affect downloading a single file.  So
     if you specify <code>wget -Q10k ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/ls-lR.gz</code>, all
     of the <code>ls-lR.gz</code> will be downloaded.  The same goes even when
     several URLs are specified on the command-line.  However, quota is
     respected when retrieving either recursively, or from an input
     file.  Thus you may safely type <code>wget -Q2m -i sites</code>--download will
     be aborted when the quota is exceeded.

<p>Setting quota to 0 or to <code>inf</code> unlimits the download quota.

<h2><a href="#Directory_Options" name="Directory_Options"><p>Directory Options</a></h2>


<dl>
<dt><code>-nd</code>
<dd><dt><code>--no-directories</code>
<dd>Do not create a hierarchy of directories when retrieving
     recursively.  With this option turned on, all files will get saved
     to the current directory, without clobbering (if a name shows up
     more than once, the filenames will get extensions <code>.n</code>).

<dt><code>-x</code>
<dd><dt><code>--force-directories</code>
<dd>The opposite of <code>-nd</code>--create a hierarchy of directories, even if
     one would not have been created otherwise.  E.g. <code>wget -x
     http://fly.srk.fer.hr/robots.txt</code> will save the downloaded file to
     <code>fly.srk.fer.hr/robots.txt</code>.

<dt><code>-nH</code>
<dd><dt><code>--no-host-directories</code>
<dd>Disable generation of host-prefixed directories.  By default,
     invoking Wget with <code>-r http://fly.srk.fer.hr/</code> will create a
     structure of directories beginning with <code>fly.srk.fer.hr/</code>.  This
     option disables such behavior.

<dt><code>--cut-dirs=<var>number</var></code>
<dd>Ignore <var>number</var> directory components.  This is useful for getting a
     fine-grained control over the directory where recursive retrieval
     will be saved.

<p>Take, for example, the directory at
     <code>ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/</code>.  If you retrieve it with
     <code>-r</code>, it will be saved locally under
     <code>ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/</code>.  While the <code>-nH</code> option can remove
     the <code>ftp.xemacs.org/</code> part, you are still stuck with <code>pub/xemacs</code>.
     This is where <code>--cut-dirs</code> comes in handy; it makes Wget not "see"
     <var>number</var> remote directory components.  Here are several
     examples of how <code>--cut-dirs</code> option works.

<pre>
<p>No options        -&gt; ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/
-nH               -&gt; pub/xemacs/
-nH --cut-dirs=1  -&gt; xemacs/
-nH --cut-dirs=2  -&gt; .

--cut-dirs=1      -&gt; ftp.xemacs.org/xemacs/
...
</pre>
<p>If you just want to get rid of the directory structure, this
     option is similar to a combination of <code>-nd</code> and <code>-P</code>.  However, unlike
     <code>-nd</code>, <code>--cut-dirs</code> does not lose with subdirectories--for
     instance, with <code>-nH --cut-dirs=1</code>, a <code>beta/</code> subdirectory will be
     placed to <code>xemacs/beta</code>, as one would expect.

<dt><code>-P <var>prefix</var></code>
<dd><dt><code>--directory-prefix=<var>prefix</var></code>
<dd>Set directory prefix to <var>prefix</var>.  The <dfn>directory prefix</dfn> is the
     directory where all other files and subdirectories will be saved
     to, i.e. the top of the retrieval tree.  The default is <code>.</code> (the
     current directory).

<dl>
<dt><code>-E</code>
<dd><dt><code>--html-extension</code>
<dd>If a file of type <code>text/html</code> is downloaded and the URL does not end
     with the regexp <code>\.[Hh][Tt][Mm][Ll]?</code>, this option will cause the
     suffix <code>.html</code> to be appended to the local filename.  This is
     useful, for instance, when you're mirroring a remote site that uses
     <code>.asp</code> pages, but you want the mirrored pages to be viewable on
     your stock Apache server.  Another good use for this is when you're
     downloading the output of CGIs.  A URL like
     <code>http://site.com/article.cgi?25</code> will be saved as
     <code>article.cgi?25.html</code>.

<p>Note that filenames changed in this way will be re-downloaded
     every time you re-mirror a site, because Wget can't tell that the
     local <code><var>X</var>.html</code> file corresponds to remote URL <code><var>X</var></code> (since it doesn't
     yet know that the URL produces output of type <code>text/html</code>.  To
     prevent this re-downloading, you must use <code>-k</code> and <code>-K</code> so that the
     original version of the file will be saved as <code><var>X</var>.orig</code> (see <a
     href="#Recursive_Retrieval_Options">Recursive Retrieval Options</a>.).

<dt><code>--http-user=<var>user</var></code>
<dd><dt><code>--http-passwd=<var>password</var></code>
<dd>Specify the username <var>user</var> and password <var>password</var> on an HTTP server.
     According to the type of the challenge, Wget will encode them
     using either the <code>basic</code> (insecure) or the <code>digest</code> authentication
     scheme.

<p>Another way to specify username and password is in the URL itself
     (see <a href="#URL_Format">URL Format</a>.).  For more information about security issues with
     Wget, See <a href="#Security_Considerations">Security Considerations</a>.

<dt><code>-C on/off</code>
<dd><dt><code>--cache=on/off</code>
<dd>When set to off, disable server-side cache.  In this case, Wget
     will send the remote server an appropriate directive (<code>Pragma:
     no-cache</code>) to get the file from the remote service, rather than
     returning the cached version.  This is especially useful for
     retrieving and flushing out-of-date documents on proxy servers.

<p>Caching is allowed by default.

<dt><code>--cookies=on/off</code>
<dd>When set to off, disable the use of cookies.  Cookies are a
     mechanism for maintaining server-side state.  The server sends the
     client a cookie using the <code>Set-Cookie</code> header, and the client
     responds with the same cookie upon further requests.  Since
     cookies allow the server owners to keep track of visitors and for
     sites to exchange this information, some consider them a breach of
     privacy.  The default is to use cookies; however, <em>storing</em> cookies
     is not on by default.

<dt><code>--load-cookies <var>file</var></code>
<dd>Load cookies from <var>file</var> before the first HTTP retrieval.  <var>file</var> is a
     textual file in the format originally used by Netscape's
     <code>cookies.txt</code> file.

<p>You will typically use this option when mirroring sites that
     require that you be logged in to access some or all of their
     content.  The login process typically works by the web server
     issuing an HTTP cookie upon receiving and verifying your
     credentials.  The cookie is then resent by the browser when
     accessing that part of the site, and so proves your identity.

<p>Mirroring such a site requires Wget to send the same cookies your
     browser sends when communicating with the site.  This is achieved
     by <code>--load-cookies</code>--simply point Wget to the location of the
     <code>cookies.txt</code> file, and it will send the same cookies your
     browser would send in the same situation.  Different browsers keep
     textual cookie files in different locations:


<dl>
<dt>Netscape 4.x.
<dd>The cookies are in <code>~/.netscape/cookies.txt</code>.

<dt>Mozilla and Netscape 6.x.
<dd>Mozilla's cookie file is also named <code>cookies.txt</code>, located
          somewhere under <code>~/.mozilla</code>, in the directory of your profile.
          The full path usually ends up looking somewhat like
          <code>~/.mozilla/default/<var>some-weird-string</var>/cookies.txt</code>.

<dt>Internet Explorer.
<dd>You can produce a cookie file Wget can use by using the File
          menu, Import and Export, Export Cookies.  This has been
          tested with Internet Explorer 5; it is not guaranteed to work
          with earlier versions.

<dt>Other browsers.
<dd>If you are using a different browser to create your cookies,
          <code>--load-cookies</code> will only work if you can locate or
          produce a cookie file in the Netscape format that Wget
          expects.  
</dl>

<p>If you cannot use <code>--load-cookies</code>, there might still be an
     alternative.  If your browser supports a "cookie manager", you can
     use it to view the cookies used when accessing the site you're
     mirroring.  Write down the name and value of the cookie, and
     manually instruct Wget to send those cookies, bypassing the
     "official" cookie support:

<pre>
<p>wget --cookies=off --header "Cookie: <var>name</var>=<var>value</var>"
</pre>

<dt><code>--save-cookies <var>file</var></code>
<dd>Save cookies from <var>file</var> at the end of session.  Cookies whose
     expiry time is not specified, or those that have already expired,
     are not saved.

<dt><code>--ignore-length</code>
<dd>Unfortunately, some HTTP servers (CGI programs, to be more
     precise) send out bogus <code>Content-Length</code> headers, which makes Wget
     go wild, as it thinks not all the document was retrieved.  You can
     spot this syndrome if Wget retries getting the same document again
     and again, each time claiming that the (otherwise normal)
     connection has closed on the very same byte.

<p>With this option, Wget will ignore the <code>Content-Length</code> header--as
     if it never existed.

<dt><code>--header=<var>additional-header</var></code>
<dd>Define an <var>additional-header</var> to be passed to the HTTP servers.
     Headers must contain a <code>:</code> preceded by one or more non-blank
     characters, and must not contain newlines.

<p>You may define more than one additional header by specifying
     <code>--header</code> more than once.

<pre>
<p>wget --header='Accept-Charset: iso-8859-2' \
     --header='Accept-Language: hr'        \
       http://fly.srk.fer.hr/
</pre>
<p>Specification of an empty string as the header value will clear all
     previous user-defined headers.

<dt><code>--proxy-user=<var>user</var></code>
<dd><dt><code>--proxy-passwd=<var>password</var></code>
<dd>Specify the username <var>user</var> and password <var>password</var> for authentication
     on a proxy server.  Wget will encode them using the <code>basic</code>
     authentication scheme.

<dt><code>--referer=<var>url</var></code>
<dd>Include `Referer: <var>url</var>' header in HTTP request.  Useful for
     retrieving documents with server-side processing that assume they
     are always being retrieved by interactive web browsers and only
     come out properly when Referer is set to one of the pages that
     point to them.

<dt><code>-s</code>
<dd><dt><code>--save-headers</code>
<dd>Save the headers sent by the HTTP server to the file, preceding the
     actual contents, with an empty line as the separator.

<dt><code>-U <var>agent-string</var></code>
<dd><dt><code>--user-agent=<var>agent-string</var></code>
<dd>Identify as <var>agent-string</var> to the HTTP server.

<p>The HTTP protocol allows the clients to identify themselves using a
     <code>User-Agent</code> header field.  This enables distinguishing the
     WWW software, usually for statistical purposes or for tracing of
     protocol violations.  Wget normally identifies as <code>Wget/<var>version</var></code>,
     <var>version</var> being the current version number of Wget.

<p>However, some sites have been known to impose the policy of
     tailoring the output according to the <code>User-Agent</code>-supplied
     information.  While conceptually this is not such a bad idea, it
     has been abused by servers denying information to clients other
     than <code>Mozilla</code> or Microsoft <code>Internet Explorer</code>.  This option allows
     you to change the <code>User-Agent</code> line issued by Wget.  Use of this
     option is discouraged, unless you really know what you are doing.

<h2><a href="#FTP_Options" name="FTP_Options"><p>FTP Options</a></h2>


<dl>
<dt><code>-nr</code>
<dd><dt><code>--dont-remove-listing</code>
<dd>Don't remove the temporary <code>.listing</code> files generated by FTP
     retrievals.  Normally, these files contain the raw directory
     listings received from FTP servers.  Not removing them can be
     useful for debugging purposes, or when you want to be able to
     easily check on the contents of remote server directories (e.g. to
     verify that a mirror you're running is complete).

<p>Note that even though Wget writes to a known filename for this
     file, this is not a security hole in the scenario of a user making
     <code>.listing</code> a symbolic link to <code>/etc/passwd</code> or something and
     asking <code>root</code> to run Wget in his or her directory.  Depending on the
     options used, either Wget will refuse to write to <code>.listing</code>, making
     the globbing/recursion/time-stamping operation fail, or the
     symbolic link will be deleted and replaced with the actual
     <code>.listing</code> file, or the listing will be written to a
     <code>.listing.<var>number</var></code> file.

<p>Even though this situation isn't a problem, though, <code>root</code> should
     never run Wget in a non-trusted user's directory.  A user could do
     something as simple as linking <code>index.html</code> to <code>/etc/passwd</code> and
     asking <code>root</code> to run Wget with <code>-N</code> or <code>-r</code> so the file will be
     overwritten.

<dt><code>-g on/off</code>
<dd><dt><code>--glob=on/off</code>
<dd>Turn FTP globbing on or off.  Globbing means you may use the
     shell-like special characters (<dfn>wildcards</dfn>), like <code>*</code>, <code>?</code>, <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> to
     retrieve more than one file from the same directory at once, like:

<pre>
<p>wget ftp://gnjilux.srk.fer.hr/*.msg
</pre>

<p>By default, globbing will be turned on if the URL contains a
     globbing character.  This option may be used to turn globbing on
     or off permanently.

<p>You may have to quote the URL to protect it from being expanded by
     your shell.  Globbing makes Wget look for a directory listing,
     which is system-specific.  This is why it currently works only
     with Unix FTP servers (and the ones emulating Unix <code>ls</code> output).

<dt><code>--passive-ftp</code>
<dd>Use the <dfn>passive</dfn> FTP retrieval scheme, in which the client
     initiates the data connection.  This is sometimes required for FTP
     to work behind firewalls.

<dt><code>--retr-symlinks</code>
<dd>Usually, when retrieving FTP directories recursively and a symbolic
     link is encountered, the linked-to file is not downloaded.
     Instead, a matching symbolic link is created on the local
     filesystem.  The pointed-to file will not be downloaded unless
     this recursive retrieval would have encountered it separately and
     downloaded it anyway.

<p>When <code>--retr-symlinks</code> is specified, however, symbolic links are
     traversed and the pointed-to files are retrieved.  At this time,
     this option does not cause Wget to traverse symlinks to
     directories and recurse through them, but in the future it should
     be enhanced to do this.

<p>Note that when retrieving a file (not a directory) because it was
     specified on the commandline, rather than because it was recursed
     to, this option has no effect.  Symbolic links are always
     traversed in this case.

<dd><dt><code>--level=<var>depth</var></code>
<dd>Specify recursion maximum depth level <var>depth</var> (see <a href="#Recursive_Retrieval">Recursive
     Retrieval</a>.).  The default maximum depth is 5.

<dt><code>--delete-after</code>
<dd>This option tells Wget to delete every single file it downloads,
     <em>after</em> having done so.  It is useful for pre-fetching popular
     pages through a proxy, e.g.:

<pre>
<p>wget -r -nd --delete-after http://whatever.com/~popular/page/
</pre>

<p>The <code>-r</code> option is to retrieve recursively, and <code>-nd</code> to not create
     directories.

<p>Note that <code>--delete-after</code> deletes files on the local machine.  It
     does not issue the <code>DELE</code> command to remote FTP sites, for instance.
     Also note that when <code>--delete-after</code> is specified, <code>--convert-links</code>
     is ignored, so <code>.orig</code> files are simply not created in the first
     place.

<dt><code>-k</code>
<dd><dt><code>--convert-links</code>
<dd>After the download is complete, convert the links in the document
     to make them suitable for local viewing.  This affects not only
     the visible hyperlinks, but any part of the document that links to
     external content, such as embedded images, links to style sheets,
     hyperlinks to non-HTML content, etc.

<p>Each link will be changed in one of the two ways:


<ul>
<li>The links to files that have been downloaded by Wget will be
          changed to refer to the file they point to as a relative link.

<p>Example: if the downloaded file <code>/foo/doc.html</code> links to
          <code>/bar/img.gif</code>, also downloaded, then the link in <code>doc.html</code>
          will be modified to point to <code>../bar/img.gif</code>.  This kind of
          transformation works reliably for arbitrary combinations of
          directories.

<li>The links to files that have not been downloaded by Wget will
          be changed to include host name and absolute path of the
          location they point to.

<p>Example: if the downloaded file <code>/foo/doc.html</code> links to
          <code>/bar/img.gif</code> (or to <code>../bar/img.gif</code>), then the link in
          <code>doc.html</code> will be modified to point to
          <code>http://<var>hostname</var>/bar/img.gif</code>.  
</ul>

<p>Because of this, local browsing works reliably: if a linked file
     was downloaded, the link will refer to its local name; if it was
     not downloaded, the link will refer to its full Internet address
     rather than presenting a broken link.  The fact that the former
     links are converted to relative links ensures that you can move
     the downloaded hierarchy to another directory.

<p>Note that only at the end of the download can Wget know which
     links have been downloaded.  Because of that, the work done by <code>-k</code>
     will be performed at the end of all the downloads.

<dt><code>-K</code>
<dd><dt><code>--backup-converted</code>
<dd>When converting a file, back up the original version with a <code>.orig</code>
     suffix.  Affects the behavior of <code>-N</code> (see <a href="#HTTP_Time_Stamping_Internals">HTTP Time-Stamping
     Internals</a>.).

<dt><code>-m</code>
<dd><dt><code>--mirror</code>
<dd>Turn on options suitable for mirroring.  This option turns on
     recursion and time-stamping, sets infinite recursion depth and
     keeps FTP directory listings.  It is currently equivalent to <code>-r -N
     -l inf -nr</code>.

<dt><code>-p</code>
<dd><dt><code>--page-requisites</code>
<dd>This option causes Wget to download all the files that are
     necessary to properly display a given HTML page.  This includes
     such things as inlined images, sounds, and referenced stylesheets.

<p>Ordinarily, when downloading a single HTML page, any requisite
     documents that may be needed to display it properly are not
     downloaded.  Using <code>-r</code> together with <code>-l</code> can help, but since Wget
     does not ordinarily distinguish between external and inlined
     documents, one is generally left with "leaf documents" that are
     missing their requisites.

<p>For instance, say document <code>1.html</code> contains an <code>&lt;IMG&gt;</code> tag
     referencing <code>1.gif</code> and an <code>&lt;A&gt;</code> tag pointing to external document
     <code>2.html</code>.  Say that <code>2.html</code> is similar but that its image is
     <code>2.gif</code> and it links to <code>3.html</code>.  Say this continues up to some
     arbitrarily high number.

<p>If one executes the command:

<pre>
<p>wget -r -l 2 http://<var>site</var>/1.html
</pre>

<p>then <code>1.html</code>, <code>1.gif</code>, <code>2.html</code>, <code>2.gif</code>, and <code>3.html</code> will be downloaded.
     As you can see, <code>3.html</code> is without its requisite <code>3.gif</code> because Wget
     is simply counting the number of hops (up to 2) away from <code>1.html</code>
     in order to determine where to stop the recursion.  However, with
     this command:

<pre>
<p>wget -r -l 2 -p http://<var>site</var>/1.html
</pre>

<p>all the above files <em>and</em> <code>3.html</code>'s requisite <code>3.gif</code> will be
     downloaded.  Similarly,

<pre>
<p>wget -r -l 1 -p http://<var>site</var>/1.html
</pre>

<p>will cause <code>1.html</code>, <code>1.gif</code>, <code>2.html</code>, and <code>2.gif</code> to be downloaded.  One
     might think that:

<pre>
<p>wget -r -l 0 -p http://<var>site</var>/1.html
</pre>

<p>would download just <code>1.html</code> and <code>1.gif</code>, but unfortunately this is
     not the case, because <code>-l 0</code> is equivalent to <code>-l inf</code>--that is,
     infinite recursion.  To download a single HTML page (or a handful
     of them, all specified on the commandline or in a <code>-i</code> URL input
     file) and its (or their) requisites, simply leave off <code>-r</code> and <code>-l</code>:

<pre>
<p>wget -p http://<var>site</var>/1.html
</pre>

<p>Note that Wget will behave as if <code>-r</code> had been specified, but only
     that single page and its requisites will be downloaded.  Links
     from that page to external documents will not be followed.
     Actually, to download a single page and all its requisites (even
     if they exist on separate websites), and make sure the lot
     displays properly locally, this author likes to use a few options
     in addition to <code>-p</code>:

<pre>
<p>wget -E -H -k -K -p http://<var>site</var>/<var>document</var>

<p>To finish off this topic, it's worth knowing that Wget's idea of an
     external document link is any URL specified in an <code>&lt;A&gt;</code> tag, an
     <code>&lt;AREA&gt;</code> tag, or a <code>&lt;LINK&gt;</code> tag other than <code>&lt;LINK
     REL="stylesheet"&gt;</code>.

<h1><a href="#Recursive_Retrieval" name="Recursive_Retrieval"><p>Recursive Retrieval</a></h1>

<p>GNU Wget is capable of traversing parts of the Web (or a single HTTP
or FTP server), following links and directory structure.  We refer to
this as to <dfn>recursive retrieving</dfn>, or <dfn>recursion</dfn>.

<p>With HTTP URLs, Wget retrieves and parses the HTML from the given
URL, documents, retrieving the files the HTML document was referring
to, through markups like <code>href</code>, or <code>src</code>.  If the freshly downloaded file
is also of type <code>text/html</code>, it will be parsed and followed further.

<p>Recursive retrieval of HTTP and HTML content is <dfn>breadth-first</dfn>.  This
means that Wget first downloads the requested HTML document, then the
documents linked from that document, then the documents linked by them,
and so on.  In other words, Wget first downloads the documents at depth
1, then those at depth 2, and so on until the specified maximum depth.

<p>The maximum <dfn>depth</dfn> to which the retrieval may descend is specified
with the <code>-l</code> option.  The default maximum depth is five layers.

<p>When retrieving an FTP URL recursively, Wget will retrieve all the
data from the given directory tree (including the subdirectories up to
the specified depth) on the remote server, creating its mirror image
locally.  FTP retrieval is also limited by the <code>depth</code> parameter.  Unlike
HTTP recursion, FTP recursion is performed depth-first.

<p>By default, Wget will create a local directory tree, corresponding to
the one found on the remote server.

<p>Recursive retrieving can find a number of applications, the most
important of which is mirroring.  It is also useful for WWW
presentations, and any other opportunities where slow network
connections should be bypassed by storing the files locally.

<p>You should be warned that recursive downloads can overload the remote
servers.  Because of that, many administrators frown upon them and may
ban access from your site if they detect very fast downloads of big
amounts of content.  When downloading from Internet servers, consider
using the <code>-w</code> option to introduce a delay between accesses to the
server.  The download will take a while longer, but the server
administrator will not be alarmed by your rudeness.

<p>Of course, recursive download may cause problems on your machine.  If
left to run unchecked, it can easily fill up the disk.  If downloading
from local network, it can also take bandwidth on the system, as well as
consume memory and CPU.

<p>Try to specify the criteria that match the kind of download you are
trying to achieve.  If you want to download only one page, use
<code>--page-requisites</code> without any additional recursion.  If you want
to download things under one directory, use <code>-np</code> to avoid downloading
things from other directories.  If you want to download all the files
from one directory, use <code>-l 1</code> to make sure the recursion depth never
exceeds one.  See <a href="#Following_Links">Following Links</a>, for more information about this.

<p>Recursive retrieval should be used with care.  Don't say you were not
warned.

<h1><a href="#Following_Links" name="Following_Links"><p>Following Links</a></h1>

<p>When retrieving recursively, one does not wish to retrieve loads of
unnecessary data.  Most of the time the users bear in mind exactly what
they want to download, and want Wget to follow only specific links.

<p>For example, if you wish to download the music archive from
<code>fly.srk.fer.hr</code>, you will not want to download all the home pages
that happen to be referenced by an obscure part of the archive.

<p>Wget possesses several mechanisms that allows you to fine-tune which
links it will follow.

<h2><a href="#Spanning_Hosts" name="Spanning_Hosts"><p>Spanning Hosts</a></h2>

<p>Wget's recursive retrieval normally refuses to visit hosts different
than the one you specified on the command line.  This is a reasonable
default; without it, every retrieval would have the potential to turn
your Wget into a small version of google.

<p>However, visiting different hosts, or <dfn>host spanning,</dfn> is sometimes a
useful option.  Maybe the images are served from a different server.
Maybe you're mirroring a site that consists of pages interlinked between
three servers.  Maybe the server has two equivalent names, and the HTML
pages refer to both interchangeably.


<dl>
<dt>Span to any host--<code>-H</code>
<dd><p>The <code>-H</code> option turns on host spanning, thus allowing Wget's
     recursive run to visit any host referenced by a link.  Unless
     sufficient recursion-limiting criteria are applied depth, these
     foreign hosts will typically link to yet more hosts, and so on
     until Wget ends up sucking up much more data than you have
     intended.

<dt>Limit spanning to certain domains--<code>-D</code>
<dd><p>The <code>-D</code> option allows you to specify the domains that will be
     followed, thus limiting the recursion only to the hosts that
     belong to these domains.  Obviously, this makes sense only in
     conjunction with <code>-H</code>.  A typical example would be downloading the
     contents of <code>www.server.com</code>, but allowing downloads from
     <code>images.server.com</code>, etc.:

<pre>
<p>wget -rH -Dserver.com http://www.server.com/
</pre>

<p>You can specify more than one address by separating them with a
     comma, e.g. <code>-Ddomain1.com,domain2.com</code>.

<dt>Keep download off certain domains--<code>--exclude-domains</code>
<dd><p>If there are domains you want to exclude specifically, you can do
     it with <code>--exclude-domains</code>, which accepts the same type of arguments
     of <code>-D</code>, but will <em>exclude</em> all the listed domains.  For example, if
     you want to download all the hosts from <code>foo.edu</code> domain, with the
     exception of <code>sunsite.foo.edu</code>, you can do it like this:

<pre>
<p>wget -rH -Dfoo.edu --exclude-domains sunsite.foo.edu \
    http://www.foo.edu/
</pre>


</dl>
<h2><a href="#Types_of_Files" name="Types_of_Files"><p>Types of Files</a></h2>

<p>When downloading material from the web, you will often want to
restrict the retrieval to only certain file types.  For example, if you
are interested in downloading GIFs, you will not be overjoyed to get
loads of PostScript documents, and vice versa.

<p>Wget offers two options to deal with this problem.  Each option
description lists a short name, a long name, and the equivalent command
in <code>.wgetrc</code>.


<dl>
<dt><code>-A <var>acclist</var></code>
<dd><dt><code>--accept <var>acclist</var></code>
<dd><dt><code>accept = <var>acclist</var></code>
<dd>The argument to <code>--accept</code> option is a list of file suffixes or
     patterns that Wget will download during recursive retrieval.  A
     suffix is the ending part of a file, and consists of "normal"
     letters, e.g. <code>gif</code> or <code>.jpg</code>.  A matching pattern contains shell-like
     wildcards, e.g. <code>books*</code> or <code>zelazny*196[0-9]*</code>.

<p>So, specifying <code>wget -A gif,jpg</code> will make Wget download only the
     files ending with <code>gif</code> or <code>jpg</code>, i.e. GIFs and JPEGs.  On the other
     hand, <code>wget -A "zelazny*196[0-9]*"</code> will download only files
     beginning with <code>zelazny</code> and containing numbers from 1960 to 1969
     anywhere within.  Look up the manual of your shell for a
     description of how pattern matching works.

<p>Of course, any number of suffixes and patterns can be combined
     into a comma-separated list, and given as an argument to <code>-A</code>.

<dt><code>-R <var>rejlist</var></code>
<dd><dt><code>--reject <var>rejlist</var></code>
<dd><dt><code>reject = <var>rejlist</var></code>
<dd>The <code>--reject</code> option works the same way as <code>--accept</code>, only its logic
     is the reverse; Wget will download all files <em>except</em> the ones
     matching the suffixes (or patterns) in the list.

<p>So, if you want to download a whole page except for the cumbersome
     MPEGs and .AU files, you can use <code>wget -R mpg,mpeg,au</code>.
     Analogously, to download all files except the ones beginning with
     <code>bjork</code>, use <code>wget -R "bjork*"</code>.  The quotes are to prevent
     expansion by the shell.  
</dl>

<p>The <code>-A</code> and <code>-R</code> options may be combined to achieve even better
fine-tuning of which files to retrieve.  E.g. <code>wget -A "*zelazny*" -R
.ps</code> will download all the files having <code>zelazny</code> as a part of
their name, but <em>not</em> the PostScript files.

<p>Note that these two options do not affect the downloading of HTML
files; Wget must load all the HTMLs to know where to go at
all--recursive retrieval would make no sense otherwise.

<h2><a href="#Directory_Based_Limits" name="Directory_Based_Limits"><p>Directory-Based Limits</a></h2>

<p>Regardless of other link-following facilities, it is often useful to
place the restriction of what files to retrieve based on the directories
those files are placed in.  There can be many reasons for this--the
home pages may be organized in a reasonable directory structure; or some
directories may contain useless information, e.g. <code>/cgi-bin</code> or <code>/dev</code>
directories.

<p>Wget offers three different options to deal with this requirement.
Each option description lists a short name, a long name, and the
equivalent command in <code>.wgetrc</code>.


<dl>
<dt><code>-I <var>list</var></code>
<dd><dt><code>--include <var>list</var></code>
<dd><dt><code>include_directories = <var>list</var></code>
<dd><code>-I</code> option accepts a comma-separated list of directories included
     in the retrieval.  Any other directories will simply be ignored.
     The directories are absolute paths.

<p>So, if you wish to download from <code>http://host/people/bozo/</code>
     following only links to bozo's colleagues in the <code>/people</code> directory
     and the bogus scripts in <code>/cgi-bin</code>, you can specify:

<pre>
<p>wget -I /people,/cgi-bin http://host/people/bozo/
</pre>

<dt><code>-X <var>list</var></code>
<dd><dt><code>--exclude <var>list</var></code>
<dd><dt><code>exclude_directories = <var>list</var></code>
<dd><code>-X</code> option is exactly the reverse of <code>-I</code>--this is a list of
     directories <em>excluded</em> from the download.  E.g. if you do not want
     Wget to download things from <code>/cgi-bin</code> directory, specify <code>-X
     /cgi-bin</code> on the command line.

<p>The same as with <code>-A</code>/<code>-R</code>, these two options can be combined to get a
     better fine-tuning of downloading subdirectories.  E.g. if you
     want to load all the files from <code>/pub</code> hierarchy except for
     <code>/pub/worthless</code>, specify <code>-I/pub -X/pub/worthless</code>.

<dt><code>-np</code>
<dd><dt><code>--no-parent</code>
<dd><dt><code>no_parent = on</code>
<dd>The simplest, and often very useful way of limiting directories is
     disallowing retrieval of the links that refer to the hierarchy
     <dfn>above</dfn> than the beginning directory, i.e. disallowing ascent
     to the parent directory/directories.

<p>The <code>--no-parent</code> option (short <code>-np</code>) is useful in this case.  Using
     it guarantees that you will never leave the existing hierarchy.
     Supposing you issue Wget with:

<pre>
<p>wget -r --no-parent http://somehost/~luzer/my-archive/
</pre>

<p>You may rest assured that none of the references to
     <code>/~his-girls-homepage/</code> or <code>/~luzer/all-my-mpegs/</code> will be
     followed.  Only the archive you are interested in will be
     downloaded.  Essentially, <code>--no-parent</code> is similar to
     <code>-I/~luzer/my-archive</code>, only it handles redirections in a more
     intelligent fashion.  
</dl>

<h2><a href="#Relative_Links" name="Relative_Links"><p>Relative Links</a></h2>

<p>When <code>-L</code> is turned on, only the relative links are ever followed.
Relative links are here defined those that do not refer to the web
server root.  For example, these links are relative:

<pre>
<p>&lt;a href="foo.gif"&gt;
&lt;a href="foo/bar.gif"&gt;
&lt;a href="../foo/bar.gif"&gt;
</pre>

<p>These links are not relative:

<pre>
<p>&lt;a href="/foo.gif"&gt;
&lt;a href="/foo/bar.gif"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.server.com/foo/bar.gif"&gt;
</pre>

<p>Using this option guarantees that recursive retrieval will not span
hosts, even without <code>-H</code>.  In simple cases it also allows downloads to
"just work" without having to convert links.

<p>This option is probably not very useful and might be removed in a
future release.

<h2><a href="#FTP_Links" name="FTP_Links"><p>Following FTP Links</a></h2>

<p>The rules for FTP are somewhat specific, as it is necessary for them
to be.  FTP links in HTML documents are often included for purposes of
reference, and it is often inconvenient to download them by default.

<p>To have FTP links followed from HTML documents, you need to specify
the <code>--follow-ftp</code> option.  Having done that, FTP links will span hosts
regardless of <code>-H</code> setting.  This is logical, as FTP links rarely point
to the same host where the HTTP server resides.  For similar reasons,
the <code>-L</code> options has no effect on such downloads.  On the other hand,
domain acceptance (<code>-D</code>) and suffix rules (<code>-A</code> and <code>-R</code>) apply normally.

<p>Also note that followed links to FTP directories will not be
retrieved recursively further.

<h1><a href="#Time_Stamping" name="Time_Stamping"><p>Time-Stamping</a></h1>

<p>One of the most important aspects of mirroring information from the
Internet is updating your archives.

<p>Downloading the whole archive again and again, just to replace a few
changed files is expensive, both in terms of wasted bandwidth and money,
and the time to do the update.  This is why all the mirroring tools
offer the option of incremental updating.

<p>Such an updating mechanism means that the remote server is scanned in
search of <dfn>new</dfn> files.  Only those new files will be downloaded in the
place of the old ones.

<p>A file is considered new if one of these two conditions are met:

<ol type="1"><li>A file of that name does not already exist locally.

<li>A file of that name does exist, but the remote file was modified
     more recently than the local file.  </ol>

<p>To implement this, the program needs to be aware of the time of last
modification of both local and remote files.  We call this information
the <dfn>time-stamp</dfn> of a file.

<p>The time-stamping in GNU Wget is turned on using <code>--timestamping</code> (<code>-N</code>)
option, or through <code>timestamping = on</code> directive in <code>.wgetrc</code>.  With this
option, for each file it intends to download, Wget will check whether a
local file of the same name exists.  If it does, and the remote file is
older, Wget will not download it.

<p>If the local file does not exist, or the sizes of the files do not
match, Wget will download the remote file no matter what the time-stamps
say.

<table>
<p><tr><td><a href="#Time_Stamping_Usage">Time-Stamping Usage</a><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<tr><td><a href="#HTTP_Time_Stamping_Internals">HTTP Time-Stamping Internals</a><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

<h2><a href="#Time_Stamping_Usage" name="Time_Stamping_Usage"><p>Time-Stamping Usage</a></h2>

<p>The usage of time-stamping is simple.  Say you would like to
download a file so that it keeps its date of modification.

<pre>
<p>wget -S http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/
</pre>

<p>A simple <code>ls -l</code> shows that the time stamp on the local file equals
the state of the <code>Last-Modified</code> header, as returned by the server.  As
you can see, the time-stamping info is preserved locally, even without
<code>-N</code> (at least for HTTP).

<p>Several days later, you would like Wget to check if the remote file
has changed, and download it if it has.

<pre>
<p>wget -N http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/
</pre>

<p>Wget will ask the server for the last-modified date.  If the local
file has the same timestamp as the server, or a newer one, the remote
file will not be re-fetched.  However, if the remote file is more
recent, Wget will proceed to fetch it.

<p>The same goes for FTP.  For example:

<pre>
<p>wget "ftp://ftp.ifi.uio.no/pub/emacs/gnus/*"
</pre>

<p>(The quotes around that URL are to prevent the shell from trying to
interpret the <code>*</code>.)

<p>After download, a local directory listing will show that the
timestamps match those on the remote server.  Reissuing the command
with <code>-N</code> will make Wget re-fetch <em>only</em> the files that have been modified
since the last download.

<p>If you wished to mirror the GNU archive every week, you would use a
command like the following, weekly:

<pre>
<p>wget --timestamping -r ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/
</pre>

<p>Note that time-stamping will only work for files for which the server
gives a timestamp.  For HTTP, this depends on getting a <code>Last-Modified</code>
header.  For FTP, this depends on getting a directory listing with
dates in a format that Wget can parse (see <a href="#FTP_Time_Stamping_Internals">FTP Time-Stamping
Internals</a>.).

<h2><a href="#HTTP_Time_Stamping_Internals" name="HTTP_Time_Stamping_Internals"><p>HTTP Time-Stamping Internals</a></h2>

<p>Time-stamping in HTTP is implemented by checking of the
<code>Last-Modified</code> header.  If you wish to retrieve the file
<code>foo.html</code> through HTTP, Wget will check whether <code>foo.html</code> exists
locally.  If it doesn't, <code>foo.html</code> will be retrieved unconditionally.

<p>If the file does exist locally, Wget will first check its local
time-stamp (similar to the way <code>ls -l</code> checks it), and then send a <code>HEAD</code>
request to the remote server, demanding the information on the remote
file.

<p>The <code>Last-Modified</code> header is examined to find which file was modified
more recently (which makes it "newer").  If the remote file is newer,
it will be downloaded; if it is older, Wget will give up.(1)

<p>When <code>--backup-converted</code> (<code>-K</code>) is specified in conjunction with <code>-N</code>,
server file <code><var>X</var></code> is compared to local file <code><var>X</var>.orig</code>, if extant, rather than
being compared to local file <code><var>X</var></code>, which will always differ if it's been
converted by <code>--convert-links</code> (<code>-k</code>).

<p>Arguably, HTTP time-stamping should be implemented using the
<code>If-Modified-Since</code> request.

<p>---------- Footnotes ----------

<p><p>(1) As an additional check, Wget will look at the <code>Content-Length</code>
header, and compare the sizes; if they are not the same, the remote
file will be downloaded no matter what the time-stamp says.

<h2><a href="#FTP_Time_Stamping_Internals" name="FTP_Time_Stamping_Internals"><p>FTP Time-Stamping Internals</a></h2>

<p>In theory, FTP time-stamping works much the same as HTTP, only FTP
has no headers--time-stamps must be ferreted out of directory listings.

<p>If an FTP download is recursive or uses globbing, Wget will use the
FTP <code>LIST</code> command to get a file listing for the directory containing the
desired file(s).  It will try to analyze the listing, treating it like
Unix <code>ls -l</code> output, extracting the time-stamps.  The rest is exactly the
same as for HTTP.  Note that when retrieving individual files from an
FTP server without using globbing or recursion, listing files will not
be downloaded (and thus files will not be time-stamped) unless <code>-N</code> is
specified.

<p>Assumption that every directory listing is a Unix-style listing may
sound extremely constraining, but in practice it is not, as many
non-Unix FTP servers use the Unixoid listing format because most (all?)
of the clients understand it.  Bear in mind that RFC959 defines no
standard way to get a file list, let alone the time-stamps.  We can
only hope that a future standard will define this.

<p>Another non-standard solution includes the use of <code>MDTM</code> command that
is supported by some FTP servers (including the popular <code>wu-ftpd</code>), which
returns the exact time of the specified file.  Wget may support this
command in the future.

<h1><a href="#Startup_File" name="Startup_File"><p>Startup File</a></h1>

<p>Once you know how to change default settings of Wget through command
line arguments, you may wish to make some of those settings permanent.
You can do that in a convenient way by creating the Wget startup
file--<code>.wgetrc</code>.

<p>Besides <code>.wgetrc</code> is the "main" initialization file, it is convenient
to have a special facility for storing passwords.  Thus Wget reads and
interprets the contents of <code>$HOME/.netrc</code>, if it finds it.  You can find
<code>.netrc</code> format in your system manuals.

<p>Wget reads <code>.wgetrc</code> upon startup, recognizing a limited set of
commands.

<h2><a href="#Wgetrc_Location" name="Wgetrc_Location"><p>Wgetrc Location</a></h2>

<p>When initializing, Wget will look for a <dfn>global</dfn> startup file,
<code>/usr/local/etc/wgetrc</code> by default (or some prefix other than
<code>/usr/local</code>, if Wget was not installed there) and read commands
from there, if it exists.

<p>Then it will look for the user's file.  If the environmental variable
<code>WGETRC</code> is set, Wget will try to load that file.  Failing that, no
further attempts will be made.

<p>If <code>WGETRC</code> is not set, Wget will try to load <code>$HOME/.wgetrc</code>.

<p>The fact that user's settings are loaded after the system-wide ones
means that in case of collision user's wgetrc <em>overrides</em> the system-wide
wgetrc (in <code>/usr/local/etc/wgetrc</code> by default).  Fascist admins, away!

<h2><a href="#Wgetrc_Syntax" name="Wgetrc_Syntax"><p>Wgetrc Syntax</a></h2>

<p>The syntax of a wgetrc command is simple:

<pre>
<p>variable = value
</pre>

<p>The <dfn>variable</dfn> will also be called <dfn>command</dfn>.  Valid <dfn>values</dfn> are
different for different commands.

<p>The commands are case-insensitive and underscore-insensitive.  Thus
<code>DIr__PrefiX</code> is the same as <code>dirprefix</code>.  Empty lines, lines
beginning with <code>#</code> and lines containing white-space only are discarded.

<p>Commands that expect a comma-separated list will clear the list on an
empty command.  So, if you wish to reset the rejection list specified in
global <code>wgetrc</code>, you can do it with:

<pre>
<p>reject =
</pre>

<h2><a href="#Wgetrc_Commands" name="Wgetrc_Commands"><p>Wgetrc Commands</a></h2>

<p>The complete set of commands is listed below.  Legal values are
listed after the <code>=</code>.  Simple Boolean values can be set or unset using <code>on</code>
and <code>off</code> or <code>1</code> and <code>0</code>.  A fancier kind of Boolean allowed in some cases is
the <dfn>lockable Boolean</dfn>, which may be set to <code>on</code>, <code>off</code>, <code>always</code>, or <code>never</code>.
If an option is set to <code>always</code> or <code>never</code>, that value will be locked in
for the duration of the Wget invocation--commandline options will not
override.

<p>Some commands take pseudo-arbitrary values.  <var>address</var> values can be
hostnames or dotted-quad IP addresses.  <var>n</var> can be any positive integer,
or <code>inf</code> for infinity, where appropriate.  <var>string</var> values can be any
non-empty string.

<p>Most of these commands have commandline equivalents (see <a href="#Invoking">Invoking</a>.),
though some of the more obscure or rarely used ones do not.

### Sample Wget initialization file .wgetrc
###

## You can use this file to change the default behaviour of wget or to
## avoid having to type many many command-line options. This file does
## not contain a comprehensive list of commands -- look at the manual
## to find out what you can put into this file.
##
## Wget initialization file can reside in /usr/local/etc/wgetrc
## (global, for all users) or $HOME/.wgetrc (for a single user).
##
## To use the settings in this file, you will have to uncomment them,
## as well as change them, in most cases, as the values on the
## commented-out lines are the default values (e.g. "off").


##
## Global settings (useful for setting up in /usr/local/etc/wgetrc).
## Think well before you change them, since they may reduce wget's
## functionality, and make it behave contrary to the documentation:
##

# You can set retrieve quota for beginners by specifying a value
# optionally followed by 'K' (kilobytes) or 'M' (megabytes).  The
# default quota is unlimited.
#quota = inf

# You can lower (or raise) the default number of retries when
# downloading a file (default is 20).
#tries = 20

# Lowering the maximum depth of the recursive retrieval is handy to
# prevent newbies from going too "deep" when they unwittingly start
# the recursive retrieval.  The default is 5.
#reclevel = 5

# Many sites are behind firewalls that do not allow initiation of
# connections from the outside.  On these sites you have to use the
# `passive' feature of FTP.  If you are behind such a firewall, you
# can turn this on to make Wget use passive FTP by default.
#passive_ftp = off

# The "wait" command below makes Wget wait between every connection.
# If, instead, you want Wget to wait only between retries of failed
# downloads, set waitretry to maximum number of seconds to wait (Wget
# will use "linear backoff", waiting 1 second after the first failure
# on a file, 2 seconds after the second failure, etc. up to this max).
waitretry = 10


##
## Local settings (for a user to set in his $HOME/.wgetrc).  It is
## *highly* undesirable to put these settings in the global file, since
## they are potentially dangerous to "normal" users.
##
## Even when setting up your own ~/.wgetrc, you should know what you
## are doing before doing so.
##

# Set this to on to use timestamping by default:
#timestamping = off

# It is a good idea to make Wget send your email address in a `From:'
# header with your request (so that server administrators can contact
# you in case of errors).  Wget does *not* send `From:' by default.
#header = From: Your Name &lt;username@site.domain&gt;

# You can set up other headers, like Accept-Language.  Accept-Language
# is *not* sent by default.
#header = Accept-Language: en

# You can set the default proxies for Wget to use for http and ftp.
# They will override the value in the environment.
#http_proxy = http://proxy.yoyodyne.com:18023/
#ftp_proxy = http://proxy.yoyodyne.com:18023/

# If you do not want to use proxy at all, set this to off.
#use_proxy = on

# You can customize the retrieval outlook.  Valid options are default,
# binary, mega and micro.
#dot_style = default

# Setting this to off makes Wget not download /robots.txt.  Be sure to
# know *exactly* what /robots.txt is and how it is used before changing
# the default!
#robots = on

# It can be useful to make Wget wait between connections.  Set this to
# the number of seconds you want Wget to wait.
#wait = 0

# You can force creating directory structure, even if a single is being
# retrieved, by setting this to on.
#dirstruct = off

# You can turn on recursive retrieving by default (don't do this if
# you are not sure you know what it means) by setting this to on.
#recursive = off

# To always back up file X as X.orig before converting its links (due
# to -k / --convert-links / convert_links = on having been specified),

<h2><a href="#Simple_Usage" name="Simple_Usage"><p>Simple Usage</a></h2>


<ul>
<li>Say you want to download a URL.  Just type:

<pre>
<p>wget http://fly.srk.fer.hr/
</pre>

<li>But what will happen if the connection is slow, and the file is
     lengthy?  The connection will probably fail before the whole file
     is retrieved, more than once.  In this case, Wget will try getting
     the file until it either gets the whole of it, or exceeds the
     default number of retries (this being 20).  It is easy to change
     the number of tries to 45, to insure that the whole file will
     arrive safely:

<pre>
<p>wget --tries=45 http://fly.srk.fer.hr/jpg/flyweb.jpg
</pre>

<li>Now let's leave Wget to work in the background, and write its
     progress to log file <code>log</code>.  It is tiring to type <code>--tries</code>, so we
     shall use <code>-t</code>.

<pre>
<p>wget -t 45 -o log http://fly.srk.fer.hr/jpg/flyweb.jpg &amp;
</pre>

<p>The ampersand at the end of the line makes sure that Wget works in
     the background.  To unlimit the number of retries, use <code>-t inf</code>.

<li>The usage of FTP is as simple.  Wget will take care of login and
     password.

<pre>
<p>wget ftp://gnjilux.srk.fer.hr/welcome.msg
</pre>

<li>If you specify a directory, Wget will retrieve the directory
     listing, parse it and convert it to HTML.  Try:

<pre>
<p>wget ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/
links index.html
</pre>

</ul>
<h2><a href="#Advanced_Usage" name="Advanced_Usage"><p>Advanced Usage</a></h2>


<ul>
<li>You have a file that contains the URLs you want to download?  Use
     the <code>-i</code> switch:

<pre>
<p>wget -i <var>file</var>
</pre>

<p>If you specify <code>-</code> as file name, the URLs will be read from standard
     input.

<li>Create a five levels deep mirror image of the GNU web site, with
     the same directory structure the original has, with only one try
     per document, saving the log of the activities to <code>gnulog</code>:

<pre>
<p>wget -r http://www.gnu.org/ -o gnulog
</pre>

<li>The same as the above, but convert the links in the HTML files to
     point to local files, so you can view the documents off-line:

<pre>
<p>wget --convert-links -r http://www.gnu.org/ -o gnulog
</pre>

<li>Retrieve only one HTML page, but make sure that all the elements
     needed for the page to be displayed, such as inline images and
     external style sheets, are also downloaded.  Also make sure the
     downloaded page references the downloaded links.

<pre>
<p>wget -p --convert-links http://www.server.com/dir/page.html
</pre>

<p>The HTML page will be saved to <code>www.server.com/dir/page.html</code>, and
     the images, stylesheets, etc., somewhere under <code>www.server.com/</code>,
     depending on where they were on the remote server.

<li>The same as the above, but without the <code>www.server.com/</code> directory.
     In fact, I don't want to have all those random server directories
     anyway--just save <em>all</em> those files under a <code>download/</code> subdirectory
     of the current directory.

<pre>
<p>wget -p --convert-links -nH -nd -Pdownload \
     http://www.server.com/dir/page.html
</pre>

<li>Retrieve the index.html of <code>www.lycos.com</code>, showing the original
     server headers:

<pre>
<p>wget -S http://www.lycos.com/
</pre>

<li>Save the server headers with the file, perhaps for post-processing.

<pre>
<p>wget -s http://www.lycos.com/
more index.html
</pre>

<li>Retrieve the first two levels of <code>wuarchive.wustl.edu</code>, saving them
     to <code>/tmp</code>.

<pre>
<p>wget -r -l2 -P/tmp ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/
</pre>

<li>You want to download all the GIFs from a directory on an HTTP
     server.  You tried <code>wget http://www.server.com/dir/*.gif</code>, but that
     didn't work because HTTP retrieval does not support globbing.  In
     that case, use:

<pre>
<p>wget -r -l1 --no-parent -A.gif http://www.server.com/dir/
</pre>

<p>More verbose, but the effect is the same.  <code>-r -l1</code> means to
     retrieve recursively (see <a href="#Recursive_Retrieval">Recursive Retrieval</a>.), with maximum depth
     of 1.  <code>--no-parent</code> means that references to the parent directory
     are ignored (see <a href="#Directory_Based_Limits">Directory-Based Limits</a>.), and <code>-A.gif</code> means to
     download only the GIF files.  <code>-A "*.gif"</code> would have worked too.

<li>Suppose you were in the middle of downloading, when Wget was
     interrupted.  Now you do not want to clobber the files already
     present.  It would be:

<pre>
<p>wget -nc -r http://www.gnu.org/
</pre>

<li>If you want to encode your own username and password to HTTP or
     FTP, use the appropriate URL syntax (see <a href="#URL_Format">URL Format</a>.).

<pre>
<p>wget ftp://hniksic:mypassword@unix.server.com/.emacs
</pre>

<li>You would like the output documents to go to standard output
     instead of to files?

<pre>
<p>wget -O - http://jagor.srce.hr/ http://www.srce.hr/
</pre>

<p>You can also combine the two options and make pipelines to
     retrieve the documents from remote hotlists:

<pre>
<p>wget -O - http://cool.list.com/ | wget --force-html -i -
</pre>

</ul>
<h2><a href="#Very_Advanced_Usage" name="Very_Advanced_Usage"><p>Very Advanced Usage</a></h2>


<ul>
<li>If you wish Wget to keep a mirror of a page (or FTP
     subdirectories), use <code>--mirror</code> (<code>-m</code>), which is the shorthand for <code>-r
     -l inf -N</code>.  You can put Wget in the crontab file asking it to
     recheck a site each Sunday:

<pre>
<p>crontab
0 0 * * 0 wget --mirror http://www.gnu.org/ -o /home/me/weeklog
</pre>

<li>In addition to the above, you want the links to be converted for
     local viewing.  But, after having read this manual, you know that
     link conversion doesn't play well with timestamping, so you also
     want Wget to back up the original HTML files before the
     conversion.  Wget invocation would look like this:

<pre>
<p>wget --mirror --convert-links --backup-converted  \
     http://www.gnu.org/ -o /home/me/weeklog
</pre>

<li>But you've also noticed that local viewing doesn't work all that
     well when HTML files are saved under extensions other than <code>.html</code>,
     perhaps because they were served as <code>index.cgi</code>.  So you'd like Wget
     to rename all the files served with content-type <code>text/html</code> to
     <code><var>name</var>.html</code>.

<pre>
<p>wget --mirror --convert-links --backup-converted \
     --html-extension -o /home/me/weeklog        \
     http://www.gnu.org/
</pre>

<p>Or, with less typing:

<pre>
<p>wget -m -k -K -E http://www.gnu.org/ -o /home/me/weeklog
</pre>

</ul>

<h2><a href="#Proxies" name="Proxies"><p>Proxies</a></h2>

<dfn><p>Proxies</dfn> are special-purpose HTTP servers designed to transfer data
from remote servers to local clients.  One typical use of proxies is
lightening network load for users behind a slow connection.  This is
achieved by channeling all HTTP and FTP requests through the proxy
which caches the transferred data.  When a cached resource is requested
again, proxy will return the data from cache.  Another use for proxies
is for companies that separate (for security reasons) their internal
networks from the rest of Internet.  In order to obtain information
from the Web, their users connect and retrieve remote data using an
authorized proxy.

<p>Wget supports proxies for both HTTP and FTP retrievals.  The
standard way to specify proxy location, which Wget recognizes, is using
the following environment variables:


<dl>
<dt><code>http_proxy</code>
<dd>This variable should contain the URL of the proxy for HTTP
     connections.

<dt><code>ftp_proxy</code>
<dd>This variable should contain the URL of the proxy for FTP
     connections.  It is quite common that HTTP_PROXY and FTP_PROXY are
     set to the same URL.

<dt><code>no_proxy</code>
<dd>This variable should contain a comma-separated list of domain
     extensions proxy should <em>not</em> be used for.  For instance, if the
     value of <code>no_proxy</code> is <code>.mit.edu</code>, proxy will not be used to retrieve
     documents from MIT.  
</dl>

<p>In addition to the environment variables, proxy location and settings
may be specified from within Wget itself.


<dl>
<dt><code>-Y on/off</code>
<dd><dt><code>--proxy=on/off</code>
<dd><dt><code>proxy = on/off</code>
<dd>This option may be used to turn the proxy support on or off.  Proxy
     support is on by default, provided that the appropriate environment
     variables are set.

<dt><code>http_proxy = <var>URL</var></code>
<dd><dt><code>ftp_proxy = <var>URL</var></code>
<dd><dt><code>no_proxy = <var>string</var></code>
<dd>These startup file variables allow you to override the proxy
     settings specified by the environment.  
</dl>

<p>Some proxy servers require authorization to enable you to use them.
The authorization consists of <dfn>username</dfn> and <dfn>password</dfn>, which must be sent
by Wget.  As with HTTP authorization, several authentication schemes
exist.  For proxy authorization only the <code>Basic</code> authentication scheme is
currently implemented.

<p>You may specify your username and password either through the proxy
URL or through the command-line options.  Assuming that the company's
proxy is located at <code>proxy.company.com</code> at port 8001, a proxy URL
location containing authorization data might look like this:

<pre>
<p>http://hniksic:mypassword@proxy.company.com:8001/
</pre>

<p>Alternatively, you may use the <code>proxy-user</code> and <code>proxy-password</code>
options, and the equivalent <code>.wgetrc</code> settings <code>proxy_user</code> and
<code>proxy_passwd</code> to set the proxy username and password.

<h2><a href="#Distribution" name="Distribution"><p>Distribution</a></h2>

<p>Like all GNU utilities, the latest version of Wget can be found at
the master GNU archive site prep.ai.mit.edu, and its mirrors.  For
example, Wget 1.8.1 can be found at
<code>ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/gnu/wget/wget-1.8.1.tar.gz</code>

<h2><a href="#Mailing_List" name="Mailing_List"><p>Mailing List</a></h2>

<p>Wget has its own mailing list at &lt;<a href="mailto:wget@sunsite.dk">wget@sunsite.dk</a>&gt;, thanks to
Karsten Thygesen.  The mailing list is for discussion of Wget features
and web, reporting Wget bugs (those that you think may be of interest
to the public) and mailing announcements.  You are welcome to
subscribe.  The more people on the list, the better!

<p>To subscribe, send mail to &lt;<a href="mailto:wget-subscribe@sunsite.dk">wget-subscribe@sunsite.dk</a>&gt;.  the magic
word <code>subscribe</code> in the subject line.  Unsubscribe by mailing to
&lt;<a href="mailto:wget-unsubscribe@sunsite.dk">wget-unsubscribe@sunsite.dk</a>&gt;.

<p>The mailing list is archived at <code>http://fly.srk.fer.hr/archive/wget</code>.
Alternative archive is available at
<code>http://www.mail-archive.com/wget%40sunsite.auc.dk/</code>.

<h2><a href="#Reporting_Bugs" name="Reporting_Bugs"><p>Reporting Bugs</a></h2>

<p>You are welcome to send bug reports about GNU Wget to
&lt;<a href="mailto:bug-wget@gnu.org">bug-wget@gnu.org</a>&gt;.

<p>Before actually submitting a bug report, please try to follow a few
simple guidelines.

<ol type="1"><li>Please try to ascertain that the behaviour you see really is a
     bug.  If Wget crashes, it's a bug.  If Wget does not behave as
     documented, it's a bug.  If things work strange, but you are not
     sure about the way they are supposed to work, it might well be a
     bug.

<li>Try to repeat the bug in as simple circumstances as possible.
     E.g. if Wget crashes while downloading <code>wget -rl0 -kKE -t5 -Y0
     http://yoyodyne.com -o /tmp/log</code>, you should try to see if the
     crash is repeatable, and if will occur with a simpler set of
     options.  You might even try to start the download at the page
     where the crash occurred to see if that page somehow triggered the
     crash.

<p>Also, while I will probably be interested to know the contents of
     your <code>.wgetrc</code> file, just dumping it into the debug message is
     probably a bad idea.  Instead, you should first try to see if the
     bug repeats with <code>.wgetrc</code> moved out of the way.  Only if it turns
     out that <code>.wgetrc</code> settings affect the bug, mail me the relevant
     parts of the file.

<li>Please start Wget with <code>-d</code> option and send the log (or the relevant
     parts of it).  If Wget was compiled without debug support,
     recompile it.  It is <em>much</em> easier to trace bugs with debug support
     on.

<li>If Wget has crashed, try to run it in a debugger, e.g. <code>gdb `which
     wget` core</code> and type <code>where</code> to get the backtrace.  </ol>

<h2><a href="#Portability" name="Portability"><p>Portability</a></h2>

<p>Since Wget uses GNU Autoconf for building and configuring, and avoids
using "special" ultra-mega-cool features of any particular Unix, it
should compile (and work) on all common Unix flavors.

<p>Various Wget versions have been compiled and tested under many kinds
of Unix systems, including Solaris, Linux, SunOS, OSF (aka Digital
Unix), Ultrix, *BSD, IRIX, and others; refer to the file <code>MACHINES</code> in the
distribution directory for a comprehensive list.  If you compile it on
an architecture not listed there, please let me know so I can update it.

<p>Wget should also compile on the other Unix systems, not listed in
<code>MACHINES</code>.  If it doesn't, please let me know.

<p>Thanks to kind contributors, this version of Wget compiles and works
on Microsoft Windows 95 and Windows NT platforms.  It has been compiled
successfully using MS Visual C++ 4.0, Watcom, and Borland C compilers,
with Winsock as networking software.  Naturally, it is crippled of some
features available on Unix, but it should work as a substitute for
people stuck with Windows.  Note that the Windows port is <strong>neither
tested nor maintained</strong> by me--all questions and problems should be
reported to Wget mailing list at &lt;<a href="mailto:wget@sunsite.dk">wget@sunsite.dk</a>&gt; where the
maintainers will look at them.

<h2><a href="#Signals" name="Signals"><p>Signals</a></h2>

<p>Since the purpose of Wget is background work, it catches the hangup
signal (<code>SIGHUP</code>) and ignores it.  If the output was on standard output,
it will be redirected to a file named <code>wget-log</code>.  Otherwise, <code>SIGHUP</code> is
ignored.  This is convenient when you wish to redirect the output of
Wget after having started it.

<pre>
<p>$ wget http://www.ifi.uio.no/~larsi/gnus.tar.gz &amp;
$ kill -HUP %%     # Redirect the output to wget-log
</pre>

<p>Other than that, Wget will not try to interfere with signals in any
way.  <kbd>C-c</kbd>, <code>kill -TERM</code> and <code>kill -KILL</code> should kill it alike.

<h2><a href="#Robots" name="Robots"><p>Robots</a></h2>

<p>It is extremely easy to make Wget wander aimlessly around a web site,
sucking all the available data in progress.  <code>wget -r <var>site</var></code>, and you're
set.  Great?  Not for the server admin.

<p>While Wget is retrieving static pages, there's not much of a problem.
But for Wget, there is no real difference between a static page and the
most demanding CGI.  For instance, a site I know has a section handled
by an, uh, <dfn>bitchin'</dfn> CGI script that converts all the Info files to
HTML.  The script can and does bring the machine to its knees without
providing anything useful to the downloader.

<p>For such and similar cases various robot exclusion schemes have been
devised as a means for the server administrators and document authors to
protect chosen portions of their sites from the wandering of robots.

<p>The more popular mechanism is the <dfn>Robots Exclusion Standard</dfn>, or RES,
written by Martijn Koster et al. in 1994.  It specifies the format of a
text file containing directives that instruct the robots which URL
paths to avoid.  To be found by the robots, the specifications must be
placed in <code>/robots.txt</code> in the server root, which the robots are supposed
to download and parse.

<p>Wget supports RES when downloading recursively.  So, when you issue:

<pre>
<p>wget -r http://www.server.com/
</pre>

<p>First the index of <code>www.server.com</code> will be downloaded.  If Wget finds
that it wants to download more documents from that server, it will
request <code>http://www.server.com/robots.txt</code> and, if found, use it for
further downloads.  <code>robots.txt</code> is loaded only once per each server.

<p>Until version 1.8, Wget supported the first version of the standard,
written by Martijn Koster in 1994 and available at
<code>http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/norobots.html</code>.  As of version 1.8,
Wget has supported the additional directives specified in the internet
draft <code>&lt;draft-koster-robots-00.txt&gt;</code> titled "A Method for Web Robots
Control".  The draft, which has as far as I know never made to an RFC,
is available at <code>http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/norobots-rfc.txt</code>.

<p>This manual no longer includes the text of the Robot Exclusion
Standard.

<p>The second, less known mechanism, enables the author of an individual
document to specify whether they want the links from the file to be
followed by a robot.  This is achieved using the <code>META</code> tag, like this:

<pre>
<p>&lt;meta name="robots" content="nofollow"&gt;
</pre>

<p>This is explained in some detail at
<code>http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/meta-user.html</code>.  Wget supports this
method of robot exclusion in addition to the usual <code>/robots.txt</code>
exclusion.

<h2><a href="#Security_Considerations" name="Security_Considerations"><p>Security Considerations</a></h2>

<p>When using Wget, you must be aware that it sends unencrypted
passwords through the network, which may present a security problem.
Here are the main issues, and some solutions.

<ol type="1"><li>The passwords on the command line are visible using <code>ps</code>.  If this
     is a problem, avoid putting passwords from the command line--e.g.
     you can use <code>.netrc</code> for this.

<li>Using the insecure <dfn>basic</dfn> authentication scheme, unencrypted
     passwords are transmitted through the network routers and gateways.

<li>The FTP passwords are also in no way encrypted.  There is no good
     solution for this at the moment.

<li>Although the "normal" output of Wget tries to hide the passwords,
     debugging logs show them, in all forms.  This problem is avoided by
     being careful when you send debug logs (yes, even when you send
     them to me).  </ol>

<p>However, its development could never have gone as far as it has,
were it not for the help of many people, either with bug reports,
feature proposals, patches, or letters saying "Thanks!".

<p>Special thanks goes to the following people (no particular order):


<ul>
<li>Karsten Thygesen--donated system resources such as the mailing
     list, web space, and FTP space, along with a lot of time to make
     these actually work.

<li>Shawn McHorse--bug reports and patches.

<li>Kaveh R. Ghazi--on-the-fly <code>ansi2knr</code>-ization.  Lots of portability
     fixes.

<li>Gordon Matzigkeit--<code>.netrc</code> support.

<h1><a href="#Copying" name="Copying"><p>Copying</a></h1>

<p>GNU Wget is licensed under the GNU GPL, which makes it <dfn>free software</dfn>.

<p>Please note that "free" in "free software" refers to liberty, not
price.  As some GNU project advocates like to point out, think of "free
speech" rather than "free beer".  The exact and legally binding
distribution terms are spelled out below; in short, you have the right
(freedom) to run and change Wget and distribute it to other people, and
even--if you want--charge money for doing either.  The important
restriction is that you have to grant your recipients the same rights
and impose the same restrictions.

<p>This method of licensing software is also known as <dfn>open source</dfn>
because, among other things, it makes sure that all recipients will
receive the source code along with the program, and be able to improve
it.  The GNU project prefers the term "free software" for reasons
outlined at
<code>http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-for-freedom.html</code>.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>

<h2><a href="#GNU_General_Public_License" name="GNU_General_Public_License"><p>Preamble</a></h2>

<p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in
new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

<p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

<p>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

<p>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

<p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

<ol type="1"><li>This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
     under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program",
     below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on
     the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under
     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
     translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
     included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each
     licensee is addressed as "you".

<p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
     of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
     Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
     the Program (independent of having been made by running the
     Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

<li>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
     source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
     warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
     this License along with the Program.

<p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
     for a fee.

<li>You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

<ol type="a"><li>You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

<li>You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
          in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program
          or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge
          to all third parties under the terms of this License.

<li>If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
          when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
          interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
          an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and
          a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
          provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the
          program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
          view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program
          itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
          announcement, your work based on the Program is not required
          to print an announcement.)  </ol>

<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
     Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
     apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
     works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
     whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
     the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
     for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
     and every part regardless of who wrote it.

<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
     derivative or collective works based on the Program.

<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
     Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on
     a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
     other work under the scope of this License.

<li>You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
     of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
     following:

<ol type="a"><li>Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
          source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
          Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
          software interchange; or,

<li>Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
          years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
          cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
          machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
          distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
          medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

<li>Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
          to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
          allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
          received the program in object code or executable form with
          such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)  </ol>

<p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete
     source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
     plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
     used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
     However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
     not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
     source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
     kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable
     runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

<p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

<li>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

<li>You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
     or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions
     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
     based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
     License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
     distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

<li>Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
     subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any
     further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
     granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
     by third parties to this License.

<li>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
     Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
     royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
     receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
     way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
     entirely from distribution of the Program.

<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
     intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
     in other circumstances.

<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
     the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
     willing to distribute software through any other system and a
     licensee cannot impose that choice.

<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

<li>If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
     the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
     this License.

<li>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
     to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
     the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
     version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program
     does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
     any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

<li>If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
     author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted
     by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
     Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision
     will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
     all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
     and reuse of software generally.

<li>BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
     LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
     HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
     WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
     NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
     FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
     QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
     PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
     SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

<li>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
     MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
     LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
     INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
     INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
     OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
     OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  </ol>

<p><hr><p><h2><a href="#GNU_General_Public_License" name="GNU_General_Public_License"><p>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</a></h2>

<p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

<p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

<pre>
<var><p>one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.</var>
Copyright (C) 19<var>yy</var>  <var>name of author</var>

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.
</pre>

<p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

<p>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like
this when it starts in an interactive mode:

<pre>
<p>Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19<var>yy</var> <var>name of author</var>
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
for details.
</pre>

<p>The hypothetical commands <code>show w</code> and <code>show c</code> should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than <code>show w</code> and <code>show c</code>;
they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.

<p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program,
if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

<pre>
<p>Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
interest in the program `Gnomovision'

<p>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.

<h2><a href="#GNU_Free_Documentation_License" name="GNU_Free_Documentation_License"><p>GNU Free Documentation License</a></h2>

                      <p>Version 1.1, March 2000

<p>Copyright (C) 2000  Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA<br>
<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>

<ol type="1"><li>PREAMBLE

<p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
     the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
     modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
     this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
     credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
     modifications made by others.

<p>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

<p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

<li>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

<p>This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
     under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to
     any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee,
     and is addressed as "you".

<p>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

<p>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
     section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
     relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
     Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
     nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
     (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of
     mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
     The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
     the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
     philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

<p>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.

<p>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.

<p>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly
     and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed
     to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not
     Transparent.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

<p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
     Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
     or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

<p>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

<li>VERBATIM COPYING

<p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

<p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

<li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

<p>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than
     100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you
     must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly,
     all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

<p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

<p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
     computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
     of the Document, free of added material, which the general
     network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
     charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

<p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

<li>MODIFICATIONS

<p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

<p>A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
     distinct    from that of the Document, and from those of previous
     versions    (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
     History section    of the Document).  You may use the same title
     as a previous version    if the original publisher of that version
     gives permission.
<p>B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
     entities    responsible for authorship of the modifications in the
     Modified    Version, together with at least five of the principal
     authors of the    Document (all of its principal authors, if it
     has less than five).
<p>C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
     Modified Version, as the publisher.
<p>D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
<p>E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
     adjacent to the other copyright notices.
<p>F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
     notice    giving the public permission to use the Modified Version
     under the    terms of this License, in the form shown in the
     Addendum below.
<p>G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
     Sections    and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
     license notice.
<p>H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
<p>I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add
     to    it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
       publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.
     If    there is no section entitled "History" in the Document,
     create one    stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of
     the Document as    given on its Title Page, then add an item
     describing the Modified    Version as stated in the previous
     sentence.
<p>J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
       public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
     likewise    the network locations given in the Document for
     previous versions    it was based on.  These may be placed in the
     "History" section.     You may omit a network location for a work
     that was published at    least four years before the Document
     itself, or if the original    publisher of the version it refers
     to gives permission.
<p>K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
     preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
      substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
     and/or dedications given therein.
<p>L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
     unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
     or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
<p>M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
     may not be included in the Modified Version.
<p>N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"    or to
     conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
<p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

<p>You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties-for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
     been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition
     of a standard.

<p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

<p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

<li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

<p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice.

<p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

<p>In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."

<li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

<p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

<p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

<li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

<p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a
     Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation
     copyright is claimed for the compilation.  Such a compilation is
     called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
     other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on
     account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
     derivative works of the Document.

<p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one
     quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be
     placed on covers that surround only the Document within the
     aggregate.  Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole
     aggregate.

<li>TRANSLATION

<p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License provided that you also include the
     original English version of this License.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original English
     version of this License, the original English version will prevail.

<li>TERMINATION

<p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

<li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

<p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.

<h2><a href="#GNU_Free_Documentation_License" name="GNU_Free_Documentation_License"><p>ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</a></h2>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

<pre>

<p>Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
  Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
  under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
  or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
  with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with the
  Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>.
  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
  Free Documentation License''.
</pre>
If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant
Sections" instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no
Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of "Front-Cover
Texts being <var>list</var>"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

<p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
