SON_of_MONC databox supervisory program.
Notes for January 2007.

There are two versions of the program:
(1) the older ISA version that depends on a separate device driver 
    to provide access to the BCD-databox registers and memory space.
(2) the newer USB version that talks to the databox via Luke Hillyard's 
    embedded card and either a USB port or an RS232 serial port.
    This is the one that most people should use because it allows
    almost any computer to collect data from the BCD databox.

If you are using a MS-windows computer, Rainer found that you should install
the following packages.
(1) ActivePython 2.4 (or later, presumably)
(2) ActiveTcl 8.4 (for td_browser.tcl)
(3) egenix mx_base
(4) numpy (preferred for new work) or Numeric (in case some packages need it)
(5) Pmw (Python MegaWidgets for Tkinter, download source from web)
(6) PmwContribD_r2_0_2 (Contributed widgets for Pmw, download source from web)
(7) pyserial
(8) pywin32

On Linux, you probably have python already but you may need to install
(1) tkinter (and friends)
(2) numpy or Numeric
(3) egenix mx (or whatever packege name is used on your distribution)
(4) Pmw + PmwContribD (download source from web)
(5) pyserial
