* \brief Functions for handling Bezier curves of third order. 
* 
* These routines provide support for Bezier curves in three 
* dimensions. Common uses are CAD and font outlines. 
* The IMOC user should not need to call these procedures directly.

* Version... 
* ------- 
* 1.0 : basic routines for third-order curves 
* 1.1 : 06-nov-92 : full function prototypes 
* 1.2 : 15-nov-92 : trap underflow in eval_bezier_3_poly() 
* 1.3 : 18-nov-92 : fix the polyline evaluation routine so that the 
* t_star array is never addressed incorrectly 
* (when we have only one segment in the polyline) 
* 1.4 : 22-Jan-93 : add slope calculation deriv_bezier_3() 
* 1.5 : 25-May-93 : Changed location_3D to point_3D. 
* 2.0 : 21-Feb-95 : Added N-degree Bezier curves 
* 2.1 : 11-Mar-95 : Compute the length of the Bezier segments by evaluating 
* points along the segment (rather than summing the control 
* point segments). 
* 2.2 : 05-Jul-98 : Cubic spline added. 
* 3.0 : 04-Jan-2000 : adapted for use in I-MOC program. 
* Added n_max to the Bezier polyline and allowed the 
* number of segments to be less than that originally 
* allocated.
