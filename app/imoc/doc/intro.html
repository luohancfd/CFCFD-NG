IMOC is an <B>I</B>nteractive implementation of 
the <B>M</B>ethod <B>O</B>f <B>C</B>haracteristics 
for supersonic irrotational flow in a two-dimensional geometry.
As at Version 0.1.2, IMOC is a completely new implementation 
of the Turbo-Pascal program described in the journal article: <BR>
    Jacobs, P. A. &amp; Gourlay, C. M. (1991),<BR>
    An interactive method-of-characteristics program
    for gas-dynamic calculations.,<BR>
    <EM>The International Journal of Applied Engineering Education</EM>,
    Vol.<B>7</B>(3),pp242--250.

The flow field is described as a mesh of nodes
with flow-field data known only at the nodes and
adjacent nodes being connected to each other along
the C-minus and C-plus characteristic directions.
For details on the method of characteristics as implemented
in IMOC, refer to a text on gas dynamics.
For an introductory discussion, try<BR>

Since the geometry of the mesh evolves as the flow field
is computed, it is often easier to decide what operation to
perform next based on the state of the characteristic mesh.
The IMOC software does the house-keeping and provides some basic 
computational functionality which can be used
directly or can be augmented by user-written procedures.
</P>

<P>
The old MOC program was written as a single Pascal program
and all interaction with the user occurred via its menu system.
If a new feature was needed, the core of the program had to be
edited and recompiled.  
In contrast, the new IMOC software consists of several layers:
<OL>
   <LI> A binary loadable module (<EM>imoc.so</EM> or <EM>imoc.dll</EM>) 
        which provides
        the basic functions for data storage, house-keeping and unit processes.
   <LI> A module wrapper generated by SWIG.  
        This provides Tcl command-line 
        access to the functions of the binary module.
   <LI> Tcl procedures for interactions with the basic module functions.
        This layer repackages some of the basic functions in a more 
        convenient form and also provides a simple way of customising IMOC.
        Since all of the user interaction is via the Tcl interpreter, the
        user has the full Tcl language available and may write procedures that
        provide further specialized functions. 
   <LI> A set of graphical user-interface functions that sets up a graphical
        representation of the characteristic mesh and provides access to the
        IMOC procedures via GUI elements
        such as menu selections and data-entry fields.
</OL>
This form of construction allows the user to easily change the boundary between 
what is done manually and what is done automatically by the program.
Initially, the user might experiment with the flow field solution via the GUI.
If a particular set of operations is repeated often enough, 
a script could be written (in the Tcl language) to automate the procedure.
If the script executes too slowly because of the interpreter, the same
functionality could be implemented in C and become part of the loadable module.

There are also a number of good books on the language and its graphics toolkit.
