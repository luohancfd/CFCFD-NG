<H3>Program Startup</H3>
<P>
Start up the <CODE>wish</CODE> interpreter and source 
the <CODE>moc_startup.tcl</CODE> script.
This gets the IMOC module loaded and the GUI components 
started.
Alternatively, a user's script can have the same introductory commands
and then continue on to do other things.
</P>

<H3>Command-Line</H3>
<P>
When <CODE>wish</CODE> starts up, there are two windows, one for graphical
elements and one (the console) for the Tcl command line.
All of the house-keeping and computational functionality of IMOC is
available from the Tcl command line.
Each C function that has been wrapped by SWIG and each Tcl procedure
that has been sourced as part of the IMOC package is available as a 
command.
</P>

<P>
Commands that operate on specific nodes accept arguments specifying the
<EM>index</EM> of each node.
This index is used to look up the node data via an array of pointers in
the moc_kernel.c module.
Valid index values are in the range 0..MAX_NODE-1.
For convenience, many commands return the index of the solution node.
This value may be saved to a variable for later referencei but it
should be checked as the commands will typically return a value of
-1 if the procedure has failed in some way.
On failure, the procedures usually write some information to the standard
output device (usually the console from which wish was started).
</P>

<P>
Once you have established what you want to calculate, it is easy to
automate the calculation either as a Tcl procedure 
(see, for example, the <CODE>PrintStreamData</CODE> procedure in 
<A HREF="../lib/streamdata.moc">streamdata.moc</A>)
or as a script which does an entire problem
(see e.g. <A HREF="../demo/anderson_11p1.moc">anderson_11p1.moc</A>).
</P>

<H3>Point-and-Click</H3>
<P>
Once the GUI is started (by calling the procedure initGUI), 
most of the functionality is also available via the pull-down menus.
Procedures that require node indices are satisfied by getting node
indices from the <EM>selectedNodeList</EM>.
To get nodes into this list, click on them with the left mouse button.
Right clicking on a node will bring up a dialog window displaying the 
node's properties.
</P>
