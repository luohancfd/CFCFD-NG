I think I've successfully used cell arrays instead of cell lists here, and am
in the process of removing vertex lists altogether.

Here on 6/5/05 -

The next level up from Octvce1, which I hope to incorporate code for 
parallelization using OpenMP, and also

- 1st order reconstruction
- greater efficiencies
- better modularity
- better naming conventions
- geometry engine for arbitrary polyhedrons - including parallel I/O using
  VTK XML formats
- capability to read and write VTK XML formats
- use of a 'global' data structure so I don't have to hunt for global variables
- use of inline functions (simple ones) where possible esp. for finding 
  directions
- correction to my non-reflecting BCs
- new BC capability on boundary faces
- better adaptation criteria

So basically, I hope this to be the last major version I need to do, because
I need to move on.
