#Bezier control points of Mach 10 nozzle for the X3 expansion tunnel

#Some notes on this nozzle:
#This nozzle was designed by Michael G. Davey for his Bachelor's thesis:
#Michael G. Davey. 2006. “A Hypersonic Nozzle for the X3 Expansion Tube”. 
#Bachelor of Engineering, The University of Queensland. Page 26
#The nozzle contour was directly scaled from X2 nozzle contour designed 
#for turbulent flow, as can be found in Michael Scott's PhD thesis:
#Michael P. Scott. 2006. “Development and Modelling of Expansion Tubes”. 
#Doctor of Philosophy, The University of Queensland. Page 145
#The X2 nozzle in use was Michael Scott's design for laminar flow, since 
#the turbulent design wasn't available at the time of nozzle fabrication.
