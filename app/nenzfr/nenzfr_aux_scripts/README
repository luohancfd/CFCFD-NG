This folder contains a set of auxiliary scripts that
the author has developed in order to accomplish specific
post-processing tasks using nenzfr data.

They are included here because they may be of interest 
to other nenzfr users.

Note that while each of the scripts work, they are in
varying states of completedness. Many could likely do
with a clean up and generalisation.
