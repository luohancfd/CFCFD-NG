/** \mainpage Eilmer3 -- 3D compressible flow simulation

\section intro Introduction

This is the developer documentation for the Eilmer3 source code.
These documentation pages have been generated by doxygen from special
comments embedded in the source code.

To get your code documented here, make sure that you have used the
appropriate special comment blocks in your source code file and then
use the makefile in cfcfd2/app/eilmer3/developer-doc/.

Note to all: 
Don't add the generated documentation files to the repository.
There is enough stuff in there already.
