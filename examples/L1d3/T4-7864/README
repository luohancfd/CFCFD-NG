Example T4 shot ported over from L1d2 and, before that, L1d.

This is not a good example to work with because it doesn't match 
the experimental data by a large margin.  It was one of a set of
high-pressure shots and there is no record of how well the diaphragm
was opening.  Also, it had the old, wrong piston mass.
