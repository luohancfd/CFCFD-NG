Here a very basic model for shock heated H2-He mixtures is implemented.

A number of simplifications have been made.

Most significantly, electron impact ionisation is modelled via the reaction
rate proposed by Park (2001) for H atoms in shock heated air.  This is in
contrast to the more detailed model implemented by Park (2010) for the
simulation for EAST shock tube experiments with shock speeds of 30 km/s.
The current reaction rate model should be okay for shock speeds of about
10 km/s.

Also, the energy exchange mechanisms have been approximated via the standard
Millikan-White and Appleton models, in contrast to the more detailed modelling
applied by Park (2010).

Please contact me (dan.potter84@gmail.com) if you want to proceed with using
this model for any real application, as the model may need some revision!
