In this folder there are a number of modelling approaches to the EAST
shock tube with CO2-N2 test gas.  In 'TPG', the gas is treated as a 
mixture of thermally perfect gases.  In '2T', the gas is modelled with
one temperature for translation and rotation, and another for vibration
and electrons (both bound and free).

There are two difference types of 2T models implemented:

ELS: Electronic levels as species
BS: Bulk species

The ELS model treats some electronic states as separate species (eg CO(X), CO(A)).
The BS model treats species in the usual fashion where electronic states are assumed
to be in Boltzmann distributions.
