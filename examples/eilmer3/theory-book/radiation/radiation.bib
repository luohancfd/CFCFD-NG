	Abstract = {The study details the inclusion of radiative heat
                   transfer phenomena in the numerical simulation of
                   reactive hypersonic and atmospheric reentry flows.
                   Truly two-dimensional algorithms are developed for the
                   radiative source term in the governing equations,
                   whereby the determination of the specific intensity
                   field is obtained by means of a numerical integration
                   over directions of propagation of radiation. The
                   one-dimensional slab approximation is lifted, and the
                   analysis presented allows the determination of the
                   radiative characteristics of the entire flow field,
                   rather than being limited to the stagnation streamline,
                   thereby providing the potential for an accurate
                   assessment of two-dimensional relieving effects
                   throughout the flow field. A few preliminary results
                   are presented for the Mach 47 flow over a cylinder and
                   a sphere, including a comparison of the two-dimensional
                   algorithms with the one-dimensional approximation and
                   an emission-dominated-case. The effects of improving
                   the modeling of radiative heat transfer are
                   demonstrated. The present approach can be easily
                   extended to three-dimensional problems},
