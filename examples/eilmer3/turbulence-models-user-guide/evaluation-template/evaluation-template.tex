\section{Evaluation template}
%
Use this evaluation template for all test cases.

%------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Details of flow problem}
%\label{}
%
Details of (or references to) the specific flow problem should include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Flowfield physical and computational geometry
\item Relevant physics, eg. ideal gas vs thermochemistry
\item Boundary conditions (inflow, outflow, solid wall, incoming boundary
      layer thickness, freestream turbulence intensities, freestream
      dissipation rate, etc.)
\item Fully laminar, transitional or full turbulent flow
\item Measurement techniques for obtaining experimental data
\item Type of experimental or theoretical data available for comparisons
      and their respective errors
\end{itemize}

%------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Turbulence models examined}
%\label{}
%
Full details of turbulence model used. Should also include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Which form is the model in? Low-Reynolds form?
\item What is treatment for near wall regions?
      Integration to wall or wall functions?
\end{itemize}

\medskip
This should already be mentioned in the introduction section.

%------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Model implementation issues}
%\label{}
%
Should include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Form of governing equations used (Full Navier-Stokes, parabolised
      Navier-Stokes, or ??)
\item Boundary conditions employed (for both flow and turbulence
      properties)
\item Any limiting of turbulence quantities (eg. ratio of production-to-
      dissipation of turbulence kinetic energy)?
\item Any realisability constraints on turbulence variables and/or
      normal turbulent stresses?
\end{itemize}

\medskip
This should already be mentioned in the introduction section.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Efforts to establish numerical accuracy}
%\label{}
%
Should include:
\begin{itemize}
\item First and foremost - code verification.
\item Assess errors due to incomplete iterative convergence (for steady-
      state cases only)
\item Assess grid convergence errors
\end{itemize}

%------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Turbulence model sensitivities}
%\label{}
%
Should include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Sensitivity to y+ values
\item Sensitivity to freestream turbulence values (inflow turbulence 
      intensity and inflow turbulent-to-laminar-viscosity-ratio)
\end{itemize}

%------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Turbulence model validation results}
%\label{}
%
Should include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Results to be presented in a quantitative, rather than a 
      qualitative manner. (eg. \% error stated or plotted explicitly)
\item Experimental error bounds should be plotted for validation
\end{itemize}
