\section{Conclusion}
\label{chapter-conclusion}
Wilcox's 2006 $k$-$\omega$ turbulence model has been implemented in 
Eilmer3 and validated against four test cases that had flowfields 
representative of those to be expected in hypersonic airbreathing 
propulsion. The first test case showed that Eilmer3 can be used to 
predict turbulent boundary layer profiles 
and skin friction distribution for a Mach 4 flow on a flat plate 
despite the turbulence model's sensitivity to user-defined freestream 
turbulence properties. The second test case, an axisymmetric analogy 
of the flat plate test case, showed that Eilmer3 can be used to 
predict turbulent heat flux distribution on the external surface of a cylinder 
in a Mach 9 flow. This test case also demonstrated that $y^+$ values
and maximum cell aspect ratios should be kept below 1 and 600
respectively for turbulent CFD simulations. The third test case showed
that Eilmer3 can be used to predict the boundary layer profiles of
a Mach 2 flow past a backward facing step and the fourth test case
demonstrated that Eilmer3 can be used to predict the turbulent mixing 
phenomena of two coaxial Mach 2 jets.
