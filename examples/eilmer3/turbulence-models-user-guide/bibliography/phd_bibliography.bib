	## REVIEW -
	
	 This book is an interesting and relevant book to read about viscous
	(boundary layer) drag 
	
	
	reduction techniques. The most relevant chapter, titled "Viscous Drag
	Reduction via Surface 
	
	
	Mass Injection", is photocopied and filed for future reference. This
	chapter contains many 
	
	
	references to "film cooling techniques" and "mass injection techniques".
	Please look up 
	
	
	relevant references. This chapter also describes how the ratio of
	slot static pressure and 
	
	
	freestream static pressure can affect the types of flow that follow
	after slot injection, be it 
	
	
	under- or over-expanded flow. It also describes the dilemma in the
	decision of whether to 
	
	
	increase downstream mixing (which reduces slot base-drag penalty)
	or to decrease downstream 
	
	
	mixing (which extends the length of skin friction reduction by film-cooling).
	Finally, this 
	
	
	paper also discusses the possibility of multiple slot injections and
	of improving slot 
	
	
	injection efficiencies.
	
	
	 It should be noted that the introduction in this book by Dennis Bushnell
	contains a very 
	
	
	good phase which is repeated here - "... so little is known about
	the nature of turbulent 
	
	
	boundary layers, and so much benefit would accrue to aviation from
	a reduction in turbulent 
	
	
	skin friction, that allavenues for its reduction should be thoroughly
	examined." by Schairer G

	## REVIEW -
	
	 This is one of the many many literatures on "Film Cooling", "Mass
	Injection Method", and 
	
	
	"Skin Friction Reduction". It describes experiments with a tangential
	injection method with 
	
	
	film-cooling effectiveness and skin friction reduction results. There
	are 4 experimental 
	
	
	configurations: I and III are baseline configurations with the only
	difference being the slot 
	
	
	height. II has a thicker slot lip, and IV has an elevated injection
	slot. Results show that 
	
	
	even though the modifications in II and IV result in better skin-friction
	drag reduction, the 
	
	
	base drag increase brought about by these modifications is even more
	than the skin-friction 
	
	
	drag reduction for the film-cooling technique. (Note: However, could
	these modifications be 
	
	
	useful for skin-friction reduction by boundary layer combustion?)},

	time. Using the developed transient analysis, accurate quasi-steady
	pressure data at true flight conditions can be inferred from scramjet
	test measurements in an expansion-tube facility. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT];
	As scramjet engine development moves toward higher and higher speeds,
	it will be important to continue to ground test complete nose-to-tail
	configurations at true flight conditions. Above Mach 10, the freestream
	total pressure requirements can only be met by an expansion-tube
	facility. To establish the practicality of ground-testing complete
	scramjet configurations at high Mach numbers, an expansion-tunnel
	facility is used to test a generic two-dimensional scramjet at a
	Mach 10 replication condition. As the flow produced in an expansion-tube
	facility is transient in nature, a method for analyzing point measurements
	within the scram jet is developed. A transient numerical simulation
	of the engine configuration without fuel injection is used to verify
	the validity of the technique, as well as to provide a reference
	data set for comparison to experimental data. These experiments show
	that stable supersonic combustion is established during the test
	time. Using the developed transient analysis, accurate quasi-steady
	pressure data at true flight conditions can be inferred from scram
	jet test measurements in an expansion-tube facility.},

	 Significant points relating to fuel injection that could be inferred

	 - Width to height aspect ratio of 2:1 is recommended, though changing
	it to 1:1 doesn't 
	
	seem to affect the results much.
	
	 - With closer holes, there appears to be better combustion-induced

	## REVIEW -
	
	 This is the second paper by M K Smart for his Mach 6.0 REST inlet.
	It describes the 
	
	
	experimental testing of the designed REST inlet. A Mach 6.0 REST inlet,
	similar to the kind 
	
	
	designed in Smart (1999), was used. Tests were carried out at (near)
	the design point of the 
	
	
	inlet, that is, at Mach 6.0 (on-design experiments).
	
	
	 The tests validated the superiority in terms of inlet performance
	of the REST inlet in 
	
	
	comparison with the traditionally-designed 2D ones, as first mentioned
	by Smart in his 1999 
	
	
	paper. One point noted in these tests was that not only did the REST
	inlet started all the time 
	
	
	(none was not able to start during any tests), the inlet also exhibited
	self-starting 
	
	
	capability after mechanically-induced unstarts. There are some nice
	instantaneous schlieren 
	
	
	images showing the appearance of an unsteady strong shock during inlet-unstart,
	in contrast 
	
	
	with the regular cowl shock enamating from the inlet crotch when an
	inlet was started.},

	## REVIEW - 
	
	 This is M K Smart's first officially published paper on REST inlets
	(I think there was an 
	
	
	earlier one - 21st International Symposium on Shock Waves, Paper 5330,
	July 1997). This paper 
	
	
	basically gives a brief decription of the methodology for the deisgn
	of 3D hypersonic inlets 
	
	
	with Rectangular-to-Elliptical Shape Transition.
	
	
	 The methodology used first involved calculations using an inviscid
	stream-tracing technique 
	
	
	to determine stream-traced 3D inlet shapes, which then involved a
	mathematical lofting 
	
	
	procedure developed by Barger (1981). Established correlations by
	Korkegi (1975, 1985) were 
	
	
	then used to check for boundary layer separations caused by shock
	wave interactions. A 3D 
	
	
	boundary layer calculation was then performed to determine the physical
	inlet shape that 
	
	
	generated the inviscid flowfield. Finally, viscous corrections were
	made to the physical 
	
	
	inviscid inlet shape. 
	
	
	 The design point of the REST inlet designed in this paper was Mach
	6.0. Comparison yielded 
	
	
	better inlet performances (total pressure recovery, kinetic energy
	efficiency, process 
	
	
	efficiency, drag coefficient & inlet length-to-throat-hydraulic-diameter
	ratio) when compared 
	
	
	with quasi-similar 2D inlets.},

	## REVIEW -
	
	 This is the third paper by M K Smart for his Mach 6.0 REST inlet.
	It describes the 
	
	
	off-design experimental testing of a REST inlet. A Mach 5.7 REST inlet,
	similar to the kind 
	
	
	designed in Smart (1999, 2004), was used instead due to some test
	facility administrative 
	
	
	difficulties. Tests were carried out off the design point of the inlet
	at Mach 4.0.
	
	
	 Initial tests indicated that the inlet would not self-start at Mach
	4.0. This limitation was 
	
	
	overcome by the introduction of spillage holes on the inlet cowl and/or
	sides. Numerous 
	
	
	spillage hole configurations showed that holes on side were more effective
	than holes on the 
	
	
	cowl for improving inlet start ability. It was postulated that this
	was caused by the side 
	
	
	holes spilling a larger proportion of boundary layer fluid than cowl
	holes.
	
	
	 These tests also showed that good performance is obtainable for REST
	inlets at Mach numbers 
	
	
	well below design point.},

	 This paper is the fundamental and most important paper for my PhD
	thesis. It provides an 
	
	
	analytical method of calculating turbulent skin friction coefficient,
	heat transfer 
	
	
	coefficient, and hydrogen fuel mass injection flow rate. This method
	uses Van Driest II's 
	
	
	turbulent boundary layer theory together with Shvab-Zeldovich's coupling
	parameters to 
	
	
	incorporate hydrogen combustion in boundary layer analysis.
	
	
	 There are quite a few references that were used in this paper, and
	are also archived in my 
	
	
	records for future references. I have also performed a complete analysis
	of this paper and 
	
	
	recorded that in my logbook. Please refer if necessary.},

	tested previously at Mach 6. The new model was equipped with a modified
	thrust nozzle that was designed to improve the performance of the
	nozzle. Tests were performed to measure the drag force on the model
	for Mach 6, Mach 8 and Mach 10 shock tunnel nozzles for a range of

	10 MJ/kg and the nozzle-supply pressure from 35 to 45 MPa. For
	the test model, the drag coefficient increased with increasing nozzle-supply
	enthalpy. The test results are compared with a force prediction method
	based on simple hypersonic theories and three-dimensional CFD. The
	test results are in good agreement with the predictions over the
	wide range of conditions tested. The re-designed model has a more
	efficient nozzle but this comes at the expense of increased drag
	associated with the modifications required for the cowl. The results

	 - streamwise component of injection velocity adds significantly to
