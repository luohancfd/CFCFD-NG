Gridpro import example
======================
:Author: Rowan J. Gollan

This directory contains dummy example to test that Gridpro
grids and boundary condition (what they call property information)
can be imported into Eilmer.

To test:
> e3prep.py --job=test

Further information about setting up the GridPro gui 'az' to
work with Eilmer3 can be found in::
