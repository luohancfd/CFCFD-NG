Description
-----------
This example computes the interaction of a shock wave 
generated by a 20-deg wedge with a turbulent boundary 
layer. The geometrical domain is modelled after the
experiments conducted by Kim et. al. in 1991 - see
AIAA journal paper in volume 29 issue 10 pages 
1643-1650, titled, "Skin friction measurements and
computational comparison of swept shock/boundary-layer
interactions."

Files
-----

*User-built files:*

kim_SWTBLI.py
  Input file for Eilmer3.

udf-supersonic-in.lua
  Input file for describing the inflow boundary condition.

turb_flat_plate-x-206mm.dat
  Input file that contains the flow profile of a turbulent
  boundary layer. It is used with udf-supersonic-in.lua to
  provide a turbulent boundary layer inflow to the flow domain.

run.sh
  A script to execute the example.


Running the simulation
----------------------

The steps to running are contained in the script: ``run.sh``.
This can be executed at the command line, from this working directory as::

> ./run.sh


Results
-------
The results of the calculation currently show very strong (and 
unphysical) checkerboard patterns on the surface of the 20-deg
wedge. This test case will be used by Peter Jacobs to test out
the implementation of the improved technique to compute wall 
derivatives.
