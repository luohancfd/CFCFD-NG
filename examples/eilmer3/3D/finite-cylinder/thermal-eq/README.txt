Troy and Tim's finite-length cylinder in X2 flow.

This is a work in progress, ported to Eilmer3 on 19-Aug-2009.
In Jan 2010, it runs but with a checkerboard pattern evident in the pressure
and temperature fields in the strong expansion of the end of the cylinder.
In August, this checkerboard pattern is still present but diminished.
