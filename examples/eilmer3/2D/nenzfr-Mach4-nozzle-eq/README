examples/eilmer3/2D/nenzfr-Mach4-nozzle-eq

This example can be run in two modes - 

  1. The original block-sequencing mode that exists 
     in Eilmer3 (./run.sh)

  2. The new multi-process block-marching mode that has recently 
     been built into nenzfr.py (./run-mpi-block-marching-mode.sh).
     When running in this mode, you will need a file (nominally
     named 'nozzle.timing') that specifies the max_time for each 
     Eilmer3 run. This file can either be created by the user
     manually, or generated automatically by nenzfr (when given
     the max-time option).
