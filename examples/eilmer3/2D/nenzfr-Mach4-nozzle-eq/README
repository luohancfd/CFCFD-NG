examples/eilmer3/2D/nenzfr-Mach4-nozzle-eq

This example can be run in two modes - 

  1. The original block-sequencing mode that exists 
     in Eilmer3 (./run.sh)

  2. The new multi-process block-marching mode that has 
     recently been written into nenzfr.py (./run-mpi-block-marching-mode.sh)
     When running in this mode, ensure that you have the nozzle.timing
     file that specifies the max_time for each Eilmer3 run.
