This test case allows a number of aspects of radiation transport calculations to be tested:

1) Multiblock eilmer3 domains
2) Line-by-line spectra via the Photaura spectral model
3) QSS determination of excited state populations via the Photaura spectral model

The case can be run either in single or multi-thread mode.  This choice is up to the user; to
run in multi-thread mode via OpenMP e3rad.exe needs to be compiled as:

make TARGET=for_gnu_openmp e3rad

where the gnu compilers have been assumed, and the number of desired threads set via:

export OMP_NUM_THREADS=X

where X is the desired number of threads and the bash shell has been assumed.

In the '1D' directory the radiative flux from an infinitely long 10cm deep slab of argon at
1bar and 10000K is calculated via the tangent slab approxiation.  Here the excited state populations
as determined via the Boltzmann equations.

In the 'MC' directory a 100cm diameter x 10cm deep disk of the argon mixture is defined for calculation
with e3rad.  The spectral model is the same as in the '1D' directory except that the QSS model is used
to solve for the excited state populations of Ar.  This is done to test the ability of the QSS model to 
converge to the Boltzmann solution under equilibrium conditions, and also to test the ability of radiation
transport calculations to run properly when the QSS model is turned on - in the past problems have arisen
when running multi-thread e3rad calculations with the QSS model turned on.
