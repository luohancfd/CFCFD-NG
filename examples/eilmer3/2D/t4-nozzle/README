This example is a proof-of-concept showing that the aging ESTC and NENZF codes
can be replaced by something with more up-to-date chemistry and with a better
approximation to the multi-dimensional expansion that processes the test gas.

The request was for a calculation yielding single numbers for each flow variable
and a run time that was not too long.  The equilibrium-air calculation for air
through the Mach 4 nozzle using Katsu's shot 9378 operating conditions takes
a bit under 500 seconds on a 3GHz HP desktop computer and about 1300 seconds
on a slower Toshiba laptop.

The new program is called nenzfr.py and may be invoked (minimally) as
./nenzfr.py --T1=300 --p1=160.0e3 --Vs=2707 --pe=38.0e6

p.s. nenzfr.py and supporting files have been moved to the cfcfd3/app/nenzfr/ 
directory (30-Sep-2011)
