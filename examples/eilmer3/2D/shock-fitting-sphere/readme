Shock fitting:

The grid movement is usably stable, but is still very sensitive to the grid and gas model.
Simulations should be started on very coarse grids, and additional complications such as viscous effects, clustering and reaction schemes should be introduced gradually.

Multiple blocks are supported in the body tangential directions, but only one block will work in the 
body normal direction.

3D should work, but is not well tested.
