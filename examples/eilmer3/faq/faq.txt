A catch-all for notes and emails that contain answers which haven't 
made it into the main documents... yet.

Flow Solver
-----------
*Q:* I have N blocks in my simulation and I wish to run parallel.  What happens if:
 (a) I use less than N processes in my MPI request? is that OK?
 (b) I use more than N processes in my MPI request?

*A:* The MPI version of the code assigns one MPI process to each block so
 (a) using fewer processes is asking for trouble and a failed simulation;
 (b) starting more processes is also going to get trouble because the extra
 processes will not have valid data to work with and we'll probably have
 array over runs, etc.

If, however, you reserve more process slots than necerssary in a batch job
on barrine but do start the MPI run with the correct number of processes for 
the number of blocks, the job should run fine.
Of course, the HPCU people will be less than impressed with the waste of their
machine resources. *(PJ)*


Postprocessing
--------------
*Q:* How do I get the value for thermal conductivity at the wall?

*A:* You can use the value in the adjacent cell.  
If you have sufficient resolution of the boundary layer, 
the value in the adjacent cell should be accurate 
for a heat transfer calculation. *(RJG)*

Chemistry
---------
*Q:* How does the chemistry module choose a timestep and why is its 
behaviour somewhat erratic?

*A:* It's erratic in an attempt to be both efficient and robust.

In each fluid dynamic cell, the chemistry problem is computed with its 
own, often much smaller, timestep.  That chemistry timestep is recorded 
at the end of the update for use in the next iteration. In the next 
fluid dynamic timestep, the flow has moved on so the old recorded 
chemistry timestep may not be entirely appropriate. For the majority of 
cells, and for the majority of the simulation, the old timestep is a 
GOOD guess.  However, when the flow has changed a lot between timesteps 
(think shocks or strong waves), the old timestep may be entirely 
inappropriate.  In these instances, when the chemistry fails, it drops 
the timestep a lot in order to be robust.  This however adds to the 
simulation time.

Also, whenever the chemistry is successful it tries to increase the 
chemistry timestep.  It will keep pushing it up and up and up, then at 
some point it fails and will drop by an order of magnitude or so.  So 
sometimes when you restart a simulation, you may have cells that were on 
that cusp of allowable chemistry step and then drop back to a small 
timestep because the chemistry ODE problem failed in that step.

Rowan has spent a lot of 
time tweaking the behaviour of that chemistry timestep selection that 
would give a good balance of efficiency and robustness.  Note this is 
all to do with the chemistry timestep.  This is not something that the 
user controls (or would want to control).

By the way, all of this holds true for the thermal timestep if you have 
multi-temperature simulations. *(RJG)*
