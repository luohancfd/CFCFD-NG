  abstract = {This report details the numerical and experimental
	
	investigation of the performance characteristics of a
	
	conventional radial turbine compared with a new back swept
	
	design for the same application. The blade geometry of an
	
	existing turbine from a turbocharger was used as a baseline. A
	
	new back swept blade was subsequently designed for the rotor,
	
	which departed from the conventional radial inlet blade angle to
	
	incorporate a 25° inlet blade angle. A comparative numerical
	
	analysis between the two geometries is presented. Results
	
	show that the 25° back swept blade offers significant increases
	
	in efficiency while operating at lower than optimum velocity
	
	ratios (U/C). Improvements in efficiency at off-design
	
	conditions could significantly improve turbocharger
	
	performance since the turbine typically experiences lower than
	
	optimum velocity ratios while accelerating during engine
	
	transients. A commercial CFD code was used to construct
	
	single passage steady state numerical models. The numerical
	
	predictions show off-design performance gains of 2% can be
	
	achieved, while maintaining design point efficiency. A finite
	
	element stress analysis was conducted to show that the non-
	
	radial inlet blade angle could be implemented without
	
	exceeding the acceptable stress levels for the rotor. A modal
	
	analysis was also carried out in order to identify the natural
	
	blade frequencies, showing that these were not significantly
	
	changed by the implementation of backswept blading. A
	
	prototype backswept rotor was produced and tested in a direct
	
	comparison with the baseline rotor geometry. Experimental
	
	performance results showed strong correlations with those
	
	obtained numerically, and verified the predicted performance
	
	gains at off-deign velocity ratios. This numerical and
	
	experimental study has shown that it is feasible from both an
	
	aerodynamic and structural point of view to improve the
	
	performance characteristic of a radial turbine at lower than
	
	optimum velocity ratios through the implementation of back
	
	swept blading.},

	a portion of the flow that is not turned by the nozzle vanes. The

	clearance as well as the nozzle setting angle or the throat area.
	This
	
	under-turned flow influences the power output and turbine efficiency.
	
	Furthermore, the maximum flow rate that is allowed to pass the
	
	nozzle is increased because of the presence of the clearance, altering
	
	the turbine map in turbine operation.},
