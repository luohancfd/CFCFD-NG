\section{Mach 1.5 flow over a 20-degree cone}
\label{cone20-simple-sec}
%
Let's start with a simple-to-imagine flow of ideal air over a sharp-nose of a supersonic projectile.
Figure\,\ref{cone20-flight-fig} is a reproduction of Fig.\,3 from Maccoll's 1937 paper\,\cite{maccoll_1937a} 
and shows a shadowgraph image of a two-pounder projectile, in flight at Mach 1.576.
We'll restrict our simulation to just the gas flow coming onto and moving up the conical surface 
of the projectile and work in a frame of reference attached to the projectile.
Further, we will assume that all of the interesting features of the three-dimensional flow can be 
characterized in a two-dimensional plane.
The red lines mark out the region of our gas flow simulation, 
assuming axial symmetry about the centreline of the projectile.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\caption{A two-pound projectile in flight.  A conical shock is attached to the sharp nose of the projectile. 
	 This photograph was published by Maccoll in 1937.
	 The red lines have been added to demark the region of gas flow for which we will set up our simulation.}
\label{cone20-flight-fig}
\end{figure}

\medskip
The resulting flow, in the steady-state limit, should have a single shock that is 
straight in this 2D meridional plane (but conical in the original 3D space).
The angle of this shock can be checked against Taylor and Maccoll's gas-dynamic theory and,
since the simulation demands few computational resources (in both memory and run time), 
it is useful for checking that the simulation and
plotting programs have been built and installed correctly.

\section{The simulation}
%
To build our simulation, we abstract the boxed region from Figure\,\ref{cone20-flight-fig}
and consider the axisymmetric flow of an ideal, inviscid gas over a sharp-nosed cone 
with 20 degree half angle.
The constraint of axisymmetry implies zero angle of incidence for the original 3D flow.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

         with 20 degree half-angle.
	 This PDF figure was generated from the SVG file with some edits 
	 to move the boundary labels to nicer positions.}
\label{cone20-geometry-fig}
\end{figure}

\medskip
Despite Figure\,\ref{cone20-flight-fig} being a good motivator for this simulation,
the free-stream conditions of $p_{\infty} = 95.84$\,kPa, $T_{\infty} = 1103$\,K
and $u_{\infty} = 1000$\,m/s are actually related to the shock-over-ramp test problem
in the original ICASE Report\,\cite{jacobs_91d} and are set to give a Mach number of 1.5.
It is left as an exercise for the reader to run a simulation at Maccoll's value of
Mach number and check that the simulation closely matches the shadowgraph image.

\subsection{Running the simulation}
%
Assuming that you have the program executable files built and
accessible on your system's search \texttt{PATH}, as described in Appendix\,\ref{getting-started-file},
try the following commands:\\
%
\topbar\\
\texttt{\$ cd $\sim$/cfcfd3/examples/eilmer3/2D/cone20-simple/}\\
\texttt{\$ ./cone20\_run.sh}\\
\bottombar\\
%
and, within a minute or so, you should end up with a number of files
with various solution data plotted.
The grid and initial solution are created and the time-evolution of the
flow field is computed for 5\,ms (with 862 time steps being required).
The commands invoke the shell script shown below.
This script, less the commands to generate the plot, could be used as
a template for your own simulation shell scripts.

Note that long-format command-line options start with two dashes.
These double dashes are a little hard to distinguish in the shell scripts.
      
      
\section{Results and Postprocessing}
%
Figure\,\ref{cone20-low-res-fig} shows the flow field 5\,milliseconds after flow start.
This has been long enough for the flow to reach a steady state, with the shock being essentially straight.
The plots have been produced with \verb!Paraview!, picking up the \verb!plot/cone20.pvd! file.
The time stamp in the lower left corner has been added as an \verb!Annotate Time Filter!, 
selected from the main \verb!Filters! menu.
Also, the pressure field has been plotted as a coloured \verb!surface!, 
while the temperature field has been plotted as a \verb!surface with edges!
to clearly show the computational grid.
The distortion of the grid in the right-hand block is a result of the area-orthogonality (AO) grid generator
making the compromises required to achieve a reasonably-orthogonal mesh at the edges of the block.
The default transfinite grid generator would have produced a mesh that appears less distorted
overall but would have individual cells that are more sheared for this particular block.
For the rectangular block on the left, both generators would produce the same mesh.

% \end{figure}

\medskip
The shock displayed in the pressure field shows features that are characteristic 
of a flow solution produced by a ``shock-capturing'' code such as \verb!Eilmer3!.
With the coarse grid, the shock has a stair-case appearance.
This is accentuated by the plotting program which was set to display 
the cell-average value as a uniform colour within each cell.\footnote{
If you want a smoother appearance, you can use the Paraview filter \texttt{Cell Data to Point Data}.}
Also, when following a line that crosses the shock,
a small number of cells to be counted before the full pressure jump has been reached.
In an ideal, inviscid simulation, the shock should be a zero-thickness transition.
This can be approached by increasing the mesh resolution, as seen in Figure\,\ref{cone20-high-res-fig}.
The high-resolution solution is looking clean but the computational cost, in terms of calculation time, 
has gone up from a few seconds to nearly 2 hours.

\end{figure}

\medskip
Since Eilmer3 is a simulation program, it starts with some initial (but possibly variable) 
flow state across the whole simulation domain and then, subject to the applied boundary conditions,
integrates the conservation equations forward in a \textit{time-accurate} manner.
In this case of a constant free stream flow coming onto a sharp cone, the flow field evolves toward 
a steady state.
Figure\,\ref{cone20-p-field-evolution-fig} shows the pressure field at a number of times
through the simulation.
The time increment, in seconds, between the frames was specified 
in the input script as \verb!gdata.dt_plot = 1.5e-3!.

\end{center}
\caption{Evolution of the pressure field, times as indicated.}
\label{cone20-p-field-evolution-fig}
\end{figure}

\medskip
Although not obvious in the figure, a lot of detailed flow structure has passed through the flow domain
even before the 1.5 milliseconds frame.
From then until the final time of 5.0\,milliseconds, not a lot seems to be happening.
It would be tempting to terminate the simulation at 3.0\,milliseconds, however, 
depending on how accurately you need to need to report flow quantities, you may need to run much longer 
to achieve a sufficiently steady flow.

\medskip
A key flow parameter of interest might be the drag on the cone and we can get \verb!Eilmer3! to
occasionally write out the integrated forces on the cone surface with the \verb!xforce_list = [0,0,1,0]!
argument used when constructing the second block.
This causes \verb!Eilmer3! to write the integrated forces to the log file 
at the same frequency as history files are written.
We then use an Awk program (\verb!cp.awk!) to filter the log file, 
extracting lines that have the x-force data of interest.
New users might like to use an equivalent program written in Python, 
however, the Awk language is very convenient for writing filter programs.

\noindent \topbar
\lstinputlisting[language={}]{../2D/cone20-simple/cp.awk}\index{xforce\_list!example of use}
\bottombar
      
\medskip
Before plotting the drag force history, 
it is convenient to normalize it into a history of drag coefficient.
From Chart 5 in Ref.\,\cite{ames_53}, the expected steady-state shock wave
angle is 49$^o$ and, from Chart 6, the pressure coefficient is
$$
\frac{p_{cone-surface} - p_{\infty}}{q_{\infty}} \approx 0.387
$$
and the dynamic pressure for the specified free stream is
$q_{\infty} = \frac{1}{2} \rho_{\infty} u_{\infty}^2 \approx 151.38$\,kPa.
Figure~\ref{cone20-axial-force-fig} shows the pressure coefficient 
estimated as
$$
C_p = \frac{f_x - p_{\infty} A}{q_{\infty} A}
$$
from the simulated axial force, $f_x$, written into the simulation log file
and frontal area of the cone, $A$.
Note the sudden rise as the shock structure driven by the free-stream flow
arrives at the cone surface.
There is a more gradual rise after this initial jump as the conical flow region
fills out and becomes steady.
You can now see the motivation for choosing 5.0\,milliseconds as the end time
for the simulation.

\section{Accessing the field data for specialized postprocessing}
%
Beyond the usual slice-and-dice type of postprocessing that is provided by \verb!e3post.py!, 
it may be useful to do specialized calculations on the flow data.
In this flow, the shock is expected to be straight and we can compute
that it should have an angle of $\beta = 48.96^o$, with respect to the free-stream direction,
using one of the gas-dynamic functions\footnote{For an overview the functions in \texttt{cfpylib}, 
see Appendix\,\ref{cfpylib-sec} then, for more information on each specific function,
look at the web site \texttt{http://cfcfd.mechmining.uq.edu.au/} under the heading \texttt{Libraries}.} 
from \verb!cfpylib!
\begin{verbatim}
from cfpylib.gasdyn.ideal_gas_flow import beta_cone
from math import degrees, radians
beta = beta_cone(V1=1000.0, p1=95.84e3, T1=1103.0, theta=radians(20.0))
print "beta=", degrees(beta), "degrees"
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{estimate\_shock\_angle.py} script uses the Python code libraries 
that the \texttt{e3post.py} is built upon to pick up the data, 
locate the shock position along each strip of cells in the x-direction,
and then fit a straight line to the collected points.
Note that the points from the top right of the flow solution are omitted from the straight-line fit
because the top boundary has interfered with the flow.
The shock points and the fitted line are shown in Fig.\ref{cone20-shock-points-fig} 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{../2D/cone20-simple/shock-shape.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{Shock shape for Mach 1.5 flow over the 20-degree cone.}
\label{cone20-shock-points-fig}
\end{figure}

The script below uses the data reading and storage capability provided by 
the class \texttt{StructuredGridFlow}, which is imported from \texttt{e3\_flow.py}.
Given a file containing the flow data for a block of cells, this class has a \texttt{read} 
method that picks up the data.
The flow and position data is stored in a dictionary, with one multidimensional numpy array 
for each variable.
Access to the pressure in cell \texttt{i,j,k} of block \texttt{ib,jb} is achieved by
putting these indices together as \texttt{blockData[ib][jb].data['p'][i,j,k]}.
The core of the data handling is in the function \texttt{locate\_shock\_front()}
in the middle of the script.

\section{Grid convergence}
%
Determining a single value for some parameter is only part of the complete job.
Usually, you must provide some guide as to the reliability of that value and
this is often done with a grid convergence study.
For our estimate of shock wave angle, we could follow the initial simulation run with a 
number of runs on successively finer meshes and check that the estimated values converge 
in the limit of cell size going to zero.

\medskip
Since this example is not very demanding for a low-resolution grid, 
it is easy to double the grid resolution a couple of times over and get
data over a good range of cell sizes.
Figure\,\ref{cone20-grid-convergence-fig} shows the raw shock angle estimates
converging nicely to a value of 49$^o$.
In general, this is usually the end point for our analysis.
Since we have a reference value computed via the Taylor-Maccoll theory,
we can also look at the convergence to the \textit{true} value and,
given sufficient computational resource, 
it looks at though we can get as close as we wish.

\section{Other notes on this first example}
\begin{itemize}
\item Run time for the simple cone20 simulation 
      is approximately 17 seconds for 862 steps on a computer with 
      an AMD Phenom II X4 840, 800\,MHz processor.
      Of course, the shared-memory code does not make use of the other 4 processor cores,
      however, there is an MPI version of the code that can.

\item This cone20.py file really has full access to the Python interpreter
      on your system.  Later examples will show how to use Python to write
      data files from within the input script.  Be careful.

\item Python is a dynamic language.
      It is easy to bind names to new objects within your script.
      Be careful that you do not rebind essential names that will be
      later used by the \texttt{e3prep.py} program.
      Where this might happen in a non-obvious way is in the importing
      of foreign modules (to do something interesting in your script)
      with the command ``from \textit{module-name} import *''.

\item The script \texttt{cone20\_run\_mpi.sh} is available for running the simulation
  with the parallel version of the code on a machine with OpenMPI installed.
  This script is essentially the same as shown for the shared-memory simulation
  with the MPI simulation being started with the commands:\index{e3mpi.exe!example of use}
\begin{verbatim}
mpirun -np 2 e3mpi.exe -f cone20 --run
\end{verbatim}
  The only other modification required is to look for the surface-force data in the
  log file \texttt{e3mpi.0001.log} rather than \texttt{e3shared.log}.

\end{itemize}


\section{Parametric modelling using Python}
%
Let's rework the simulation to explore the gas-dynamics a little more and also
make use of the parametric capabilities of the Python input script.
We'll first parameterize the descriptions of the flow and the geometric description
of the flow domain by replacing some of the literal numeric values of the original script
with variables and simple algebraic expressions.

\medskip
Specifically, let's introduce a variable, $M$, for the Mach number of the in-flow stream and
then compute the velocity from that value and the estimated sound-speed of that in-coming stream.
This gives us a convenient way of specifying a sample Mach number so we can explore the response 
of the simulated flow field to a range on inflow Mach numbers.
We'll also describe the cone by it's half angle and axial length.
From these items, we can compute the base radius.
For the remaining key items defining the flow domain, we need to know where the apex of the cone 
is placed with respect to the inflow boundary and we need to say how far away the top-edge 
of the flow domain is from the axis.
Finally, to make the grid generation a little more convenient as we change the boundaries 
of the flow domain, we'll define a cell size as length $dx$, and determine numbers of cells 
within each block as an overall length-scale of each dimension of the block 
divided by this cell size.

\section{Exploring the gas dynamics}
%
Except for a small difference in the number of cells in the x-direction of each block,
Figure\,\ref{conep-20-degrees-fig} shows the same flow field 5\,milliseconds after flow start
as Figure\,\ref{cone20-low-res-fig}.
It has the same straight, attached shock and same range of pressures displayed.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\caption{Pressure field for the low-resolution simulation 
         of Mach 1.5 flow over a cone with 20 degree half-angle.}
\label{conep-20-degrees-fig}
\end{figure}

\medskip
Looking up the conical shock charts in NACA-1135\,\cite{ames_53}, we can see that a 32 degree cone 
falls outside the shock-polar for a free-stream Mach number of 1.5 and so should have a detached shock.
Let's try that by changing the value of \verb!theta! from 20 to 32.
That's all that needs to be done before re-running the prepration program and main simulation program,
with the calculations to get the appropriate velocity already encoded within the user input script.
Figure\,\ref{conep-32-degrees-fig} shows the resulting pressure field at 5\,ms.

\medskip
The result is not quite as expected because the flow has choked between the conical surface and
the upper edge of the domain, with its default \verb!SlipWallBC! boundary condition, 
that acts as a smooth inside wall of a slippery pipe.
The obvious fix to attempt is to increase the height of the flow domain 
by setting $H$ to a larger value.
Figure\,\ref{conep-32-degrees-H-1p6-5ms-fig} shows the resulting pressure field at 5\,ms 
for an inflow Mach number of 1.5, which should have a detached shock, and
for a free-stream Mach number of 1.6, which should have an attached shock, 
according to the inviscid flow theory.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\label{conep-32-degrees-H-1p6-5ms-fig}
\end{figure}

\medskip
Now, the results are looking better, with the shocks looking quite orderly in each simulation.
The Mach 1.6 flow has a straighter shock and a cleaner start at the tip of the cone, 
such that it looks attached in this fairly low resolution simulation.
At this point, we could be tempted to declare victory and head to the Red Room 
to study the generation of high quality multi-block grids 
as shown in Figure\,\ref{the-clustered-bottle-fig}.
However, we want to be good students of CFD and shall confirm that the flows 
really have reached steady state by running the simulations for a longer time.
Besides, the simulations are being done in less than a minute each
so how much extra effort can it be?

\medskip
Approximately 5 minutes later, you see the results shown 
in Figure\,\ref{conep-32-degrees-H-1p6-15ms-fig} and you wish that you had left for the Red Room some 
time earlier.
The Mach 1.6 shock looks good and a little straighter, as it should,
but the Mach 1.5 case is not showing the desired result.
Why, with such a small difference in inflow specification should there be such a big difference?
And, why does that difference seem to come from downstream?

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}

\label{conep-32-degrees-H-1p6-15ms-fig}
\end{figure}

\medskip
If you ask a tutor at this point, you are likely to be asked: 
``What does the Mach number look like, especially at the outflow boundary?''
In preparation, you use the \verb!--add-mach! option to your \verb!e3post.py! command
and produce the plots shown in Figure\,\ref{conep-32-degrees-H-1p6-15ms-M-field-fig}.
The Mach number approaching the exit plane for the Mach 1.6 inflow is transonic but
the Mach numbers for the Mach 1.5 inflow are very low for the near-normal shock processed flow
but, even for the little bit of flow processed by the oblique shock, they re looking to be
well below sonic conditions.
The simple \verb!ExtrapolateOutBC! applied to the outflow boundary 
does not handle subsonic flow across it very well at all,
and results in the whole simulation not being a good representation of the physical situation.
The fix is to alter the flow domain, so that the outflow is mostly supersonic.

\end{figure}

      
\section{Building a more robust simulation}
%
The fix is very much as you should do in a physical experiment.
If a boundary effect is messing with your flow, move that boundary away.
Fortunately, this is (usually) easy to do in a numerical simulation.
Here, we will add another block to the downstream edge of the original domain and 
effectively move the outflow further downstream.
This extra block (\verb!blk_2! in the following input script) allows the flow 
to regain supersonic flow conditions before crossing the outflow boundary.

\subsection{Final results}
%
For a domain height $H=2$, Figure\,\ref{conep-32-degrees-H-2-M-field-30ms-fig} 
shows the Mach number field at the simulation time of 30\,milliseconds.
This is double the time shown in the short-domain simulations, where the flow was clearly choked.
The slightly detached shock from the cone tip is much cleaner but the upper boundary is
still showing a strong effect with a near-normal shock processing the upper part of the inflow.
The slightly-subsonic values of mach number immediately behind the detached shock are clearly
shown in light blue.

Since we've made all this effort at getting the downstream boundary condition behaving well,
we should take advantage of the parametric modelling once more and finish the job 
by raising the flow domain height simply by setting $H = 3$ and running the simulation again.
This time, the flow field in Figure\,\ref{conep-32-degrees-H-3-M-field-30ms-fig} appears to be clean 
and mostly free from obvious boundary induced problems.
The \verb!ExtrapolateOutBC! boundary has mostly a clear supersonic flow crossing it and can probably
be trusted to behave well.
This would be the correct time to declare victory, however, 
the tutor now points out that the expansion radiating from the corner at the end of the conical surface
is probably affecting the whole of the subsonic region behind the curved shock.
