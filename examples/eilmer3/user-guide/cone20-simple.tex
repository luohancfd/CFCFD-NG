\section{Mach 1.5 flow over a 20-degree cone}
\label{cone20-simple-sec}
%
Let's start with a simple-to-imagine flow of ideal air over a sharp-nose of a supersonic projectile.
Figure\,\ref{cone20-flight-fig} is a reproduction of Fig.\,3 from Maccoll's 1937 paper\,\cite{maccoll_1937a} 
and shows a shadowgraph image of a two-pounder projectile, in flight at Mach 1.576.
We'll restrict our simulation to just the gas flow coming onto and moving up the conical surface 
of the projectile and work in a frame of reference attached to the projectile.
Further, we will assume that all of the interesting features of the three-dimensional flow can be 
characterized in a two-dimensional plane.
The red lines mark out the region of our gas flow simulation, 
assuming axial symmetry about the centreline of the projectile.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\caption{A two-pound projectile in flight.  A conical shock is attached to the sharp nose of the projectile. 
	 This photograph was published by Maccoll in 1937.
	 The red lines have been added to demark the region of gas flow for which we will set up our simulation.}
\label{cone20-flight-fig}
\end{figure}

\medskip
The resulting flow, in the steady-state limit, should have a single shock that is 
straight in this 2D meridional plane (but conical in the original 3D space).
The angle of this shock can be checked against Taylor and Maccoll's gas-dynamic theory and,
since the simulation demands few computational resources (in both memory and run time), 
it is useful for checking that the simulation and
plotting programs have been built and installed correctly.

\section{The simulation}
%
To build our simulation, we abstract the boxed region from Figure\,\ref{cone20-flight-fig}
and consider the axisymmetric flow of an ideal, inviscid gas over a sharp-nosed cone 
with 20 degree half angle.
The constraint of axisymmetry implies zero angle of incidence for the original 3D flow.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

         with 20 degree half-angle.
	 This PDF figure was generated from the SVG file with some edits 
	 to move the boundary labels to nicer positions.}
\label{cone20-geometry-fig}
\end{figure}

\medskip
Despite Figure\,\ref{cone20-flight-fig} being a good motivator for this simulation,
the free-stream conditions of $p_{\infty} = 95.84$\,kPa, $T_{\infty} = 1103$\,K
and $u_{\infty} = 1000$\,m/s are actually related to the shock-over-ramp test problem
in the original ICASE Report\,\cite{jacobs_91d} and are set to give a Mach number of 1.5.
It is left as an exercise for the reader to run a simulation at Maccoll's value of
Mach number and check that the simulation closely matches the shadowgraph image.

\subsection{Running the simulation}
%
Assuming that you have the program executable files built and
accessible on your system's search \texttt{PATH}, as described in Appendix\,\ref{getting-started-file},
try the following commands:\\
%
\topbar\\
\texttt{\$ cd $\sim$/cfcfd3/examples/eilmer3/2D/cone20-simple/}\\
\texttt{\$ ./cone20\_run.sh}\\
\bottombar\\
%
and, within a minute or so, you should end up with a number of files
with various solution data plotted.
The grid and initial solution are created and the time-evolution of the
flow field is computed for 5\,ms (with 862 time steps being required).
The commands invoke the shell script shown below.
This script, less the commands to generate the plot, could be used as
a template for your own simulation shell scripts.

Note that long-format command-line options start with two dashes.
These double dashes are a little hard to distinguish in the shell scripts.
      
      
\section{Results and Postprocessing}
%
Figure\,\ref{cone20-low-res-fig} shows the flow field 5\,milliseconds after flow start.
This has been long enough for the flow to reach a steady state, with the shock being essentially straight.
The plots have been produced with \verb!Paraview!, picking up the \verb!plot/cone20.pvd! file.
The time stamp in the lower left corner has been added as an \verb!Annotate Time Filter!, 
selected from the main \verb!Filters! menu.
Also, the pressure field has been plotted as a coloured \verb!surface!, 
while the temperature field has been plotted as a \verb!surface with edges!
to clearly show the computational grid.
The distortion of the grid in the right-hand block is a result of the area-orthogonality (AO) grid generator
making the compromises required to achieve a reasonably-orthogonal mesh at the edges of the block.
The default transfinite grid generator would have produced a mesh that appears less distorted
overall but would have individual cells that are more sheared for this particular block.
For the rectangular block on the left, both generators would produce the same mesh.

\medskip
The shock displayed in the pressure field shows features that are characteristic 
of a flow solution produced by a ``shock-capturing'' code such as \verb!Eilmer3!.
With the coarse grid, the shock has a stair-case appearance.
This is accentuated by the plotting program which was set to display 
the cell-average value as a uniform colour within each cell.\footnote{
If you want a smoother appearance, you can use the Paraview filter \texttt{Cell Data to Point Data}.}
Also, when following a line that crosses the shock,
a small number of cells to be counted before the full pressure jump has been reached.
In an ideal, inviscid simulation, the shock should be a zero-thickness transition.
This can be approached by increasing the mesh resolution, as seen in Figure\,\ref{cone20-high-res-fig}.
The high-resolution solution is looking clean but the computational cost, in terms of calculation time, 
has gone up from a few seconds to nearly 2 hours.

\medskip
Since Eilmer3 is a simulation program, it starts with some initial (but possibly variable) 
flow state across the whole simulation domain and then, subject to the applied boundary conditions,
integrates the conservation equations forward in a \textit{time-accurate} manner.
In this case of a constant free stream flow coming onto a sharp cone, the flow field evolves toward 
a steady state.
Figure\,\ref{cone20-p-field-evolution-fig} shows the pressure field at a number of times
through the simulation.
The time increment, in seconds, between the frames was specified 
in the input script as \verb!gdata.dt_plot = 1.5e-3!.

\label{cone20-p-field-evolution-fig}
\end{figure}

\medskip
Although not obvious in the figure, a lot of detailed flow structure has passed through the flow domain
even before the 1.5 milliseconds frame.
From then until the final time of 5.0\,milliseconds, not a lot seems to be happening.
It would be tempting to terminate the simulation at 3.0\,milliseconds, however, 
depending on how accurately you need to need to report flow quantities, you may need to run much longer 
to achieve a sufficiently steady flow.

\medskip
A key flow parameter of interest might be the drag on the cone and we can get \verb!Eilmer3! to
occasionally write out the integrated forces on the cone surface with the \verb!xforce_list = [0,0,1,0]!
argument used when constructing the second block.
This causes \verb!Eilmer3! to write the integrated forces to the log file 
at the same frequency as history files are written.
We then use an Awk program (\verb!cp.awk!) to filter the log file, 
extracting lines that have the x-force data of interest.
New users might like to use an equivalent program written in Python, 
however, the Awk language is very convenient for writing filter programs.

\noindent \topbar
\lstinputlisting[language={}]{../2D/cone20-simple/cp.awk}\index{xforce\_list!example of use}
\bottombar
      
\medskip
Before plotting the drag force history, 
it is convenient to normalize it into a history of drag coefficient.
From Chart 5 in Ref.\,\cite{ames_53}, the expected steady-state shock wave
angle is 49$^o$ and, from Chart 6, the pressure coefficient is
$$
\frac{p_{cone-surface} - p_{\infty}}{q_{\infty}} \approx 0.387
$$
and the dynamic pressure for the specified free stream is
$q_{\infty} = \frac{1}{2} \rho_{\infty} u_{\infty}^2 \approx 151.38$\,kPa.
Figure~\ref{cone20-axial-force-fig} shows the pressure coefficient 
estimated as
$$
C_p = \frac{f_x - p_{\infty} A}{q_{\infty} A}
$$
from the simulated axial force, $f_x$, written into the simulation log file
and frontal area of the cone, $A$.
Note the sudden rise as the shock structure driven by the free-stream flow
arrives at the cone surface.
There is a more gradual rise after this initial jump as the conical flow region
fills out and becomes steady.
You can now see the motivation for choosing 5.0\,milliseconds as the end time
for the simulation.

\section{Accessing the field data for specialized postprocessing}
%
Beyond the usual slice-and-dice type of postprocessing that is provided by \verb!e3post.py!, 
it may be useful to do specialized calculations on the flow data.
In this flow, the shock is expected to be straight and we can compute
that it should have an angle of $\beta = 48.96^o$, with respect to the free-stream direction,
using one of the gas-dynamic functions\footnote{For an overview the functions in \texttt{cfpylib}, 
see Appendix\,\ref{cfpylib-sec} then, for more information on each specific function,
look at the web site \texttt{http://cfcfd.mechmining.uq.edu.au/} under the heading \texttt{Libraries}.} 
from \verb!cfpylib!
\begin{verbatim}
from cfpylib.gasdyn.ideal_gas_flow import beta_cone
from math import degrees, radians
beta = beta_cone(V1=1000.0, p1=95.84e3, T1=1103.0, theta=radians(20.0))
print "beta=", degrees(beta), "degrees"
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{estimate\_shock\_angle.py} script uses the Python code libraries 
that the \texttt{e3post.py} is built upon to pick up the data, 
locate the shock position along each strip of cells in the x-direction,
and then fit a straight line to the collected points.
Note that the points from the top right of the flow solution are omitted from the straight-line fit
because the top boundary has interfered with the flow.
The shock points and the fitted line are shown in Fig.\ref{cone20-shock-points-fig} 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{../2D/cone20-simple/shock-shape.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{Shock shape for Mach 1.5 flow over the 20-degree cone.}
\label{cone20-shock-points-fig}
\end{figure}

The script below uses the data reading and storage capability provided by 
the class \texttt{StructuredGridFlow}, which is imported from \texttt{e3\_flow.py}.
Given a file containing the flow data for a block of cells, this class has a \texttt{read} 
method that picks up the data.
The flow and position data is stored in a dictionary, with one multidimensional numpy array 
for each variable.
Access to the pressure in cell \texttt{i,j,k} of block \texttt{ib,jb} is achieved by
putting these indices together as \texttt{blockData[ib][jb].data['p'][i,j,k]}.
The core of the data handling is in the function \texttt{locate\_shock\_front()}
in the middle of the script.

\section{Grid convergence}
%
Determining a single value for some parameter is only part of the complete job.
Usually, you must provide some guide as to the reliability of that value and
this is often done with a grid convergence study.
For our estimate of shock wave angle, we could follow the initial simulation run with a 
number of runs on successively finer meshes and check that the estimated values converge 
in the limit of cell size going to zero.

\medskip
Since this example is not very demanding for a low-resolution grid, 
it is easy to double the grid resolution a couple of times over and get
data over a good range of cell sizes.
Figure\,\ref{cone20-grid-convergence-fig} shows the raw shock angle estimates
converging nicely to a value of 49$^o$.
In general, this is usually the end point for our analysis.
Since we have a reference value computed via the Taylor-Maccoll theory,
we can also look at the convergence to the \textit{true} value and,
given sufficient computational resource, 
it looks at though we can get as close as we wish.

\section{Parametric modelling}
%
Let's rework the simulation as a 2D flow and make use of the parametric capabilities of the 
Python input script...

\textbf{TODO} fill in the description of the cone20-parametric exercise.


\section{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
\item Run time for the simple cone20 simulation 
      is approximately 17 seconds for 862 steps on a computer with 
      an AMD Phenom II X4 840, 800\,MHz processor.
      Of course, the shared-memory code does not make use of the other 4 processor cores,
      however, there is an MPI version of the code that can.

\item This cone20.py file really has full access to the Python interpreter
      on your system.  Later examples will show how to use Python to write
      data files from within the input script.  Be careful.

\item Python is a dynamic language.
      It is easy to bind names to new objects within your script.
      Be careful that you do not rebind essential names that will be
      later used by the \texttt{e3prep.py} program.
      Where this might happen in a non-obvious way is in the importing
      of foreign modules (to do something interesting in your script)
      with the command ``from \textit{module-name} import *''.

\item The script \texttt{cone20\_run\_mpi.sh} is available for running the simulation
  with the parallel version of the code on a machine with OpenMPI installed.
  This script is essentially the same as shown for the shared-memory simulation
  with the MPI simulation being started with the commands:\index{e3mpi.exe!example of use}
\begin{verbatim}
mpirun -np 2 e3mpi.exe -f cone20 --run
\end{verbatim}
  The only other modification required is to look for the surface-force data in the
  log file \texttt{e3mpi.0001.log} rather than \texttt{e3shared.log}.

\end{itemize}
