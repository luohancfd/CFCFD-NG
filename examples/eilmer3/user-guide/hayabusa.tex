The Hayabusa spacecraft was developed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency to return a sample 
of a near-Earth asteroid to Earth for scientific analysis.
The re-entry of the spacecraft into the Earths atmosphere in June 2010 
occurred at an estimated velocity of 12.2\,km/s and 
was observed by a number of teams via ground and airborne instruments%~\cite{butts_2010}.
The high entry velocity for Hayabusa makes it an interesting case for radiation--flowfield coupling.
The peak heating condition was predicted to occur at an altitude of X\,km and 
a velocity of 11.6\,km/s~\cite{SFA2003}.
