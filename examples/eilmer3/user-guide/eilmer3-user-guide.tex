\centerline{\textbf{Preface}}
Eilmer3 is an integrated collection of programs for the simulation of transient,
compressible flow in two and three spatial dimensions.
It provides a preparation program that can be used to set up a database of
simulation parameters, a block-structured grid defining the flow domain and an
initial flow field.
These items are then used as a starting point for the main simulation program
which computes a series of snapshots of the evolving flow.
Eilmer3 is part of the larger collection of compressible flow simulation codes
found at \url{http://cfcfd.mechmining.uq.edu.au/}.

\medskip
This user guide contains a collection of example simulations: scripts, results
and commentary.
It may be convenient for new users of the code to identify an example
close to the situation that they wish to model and then adapt the 
scripts for that example.

\part{Introduction}

\section{Compressible flow simulation and the Eilmer3 code}
%
Eilmer3 code is an integrated collection of programs for the numerical simulation of transient,
compressible gas flows in two and three dimensions.
These programs answer the "What if ... ?" type of question where you will set up a flow situation by 
defining the spatial domain in which the gas moves,
set an initial gas state throughout this domain, 
specify boundary condition constraints to the edges of the domain and
then let the gas flow evolve according to the rules of gas dynamics.

\medskip
The definition of the flow domain includes a mesh of finite-volume cells,
together with boundary conditions such a solid no-slip walls, inflow surfaces and outflow surfaces.
To help with the set up of this domain, the code collection includes a preparation program (\texttt{e3prep.py}) 
that can be used to set up a database of simulation parameters, 
a block-structured, body-fitted mesh defining the flow domain and an initial flow-field specification.
This preparation program includes a mesh generator that can accept a description of the flow domain
in terms of boundary surfaces and then generate the block-structured mesh of finite-volume cells.
The mesh and initial flow state can then used as a starting point for the main simulation program (\texttt{e3shared.exe})
which computes a series of snapshots of the evolving flow.
Finally, a rudimentary but versatile postprocessing program (\texttt{e3post.py}) makes the flow data
available for further analysis.

\medskip
If you wish to integrate CFD analysis in your design process, it is probably easiest to have in mind
a family of domain shapes or inflow conditions, with variations defined by a small set of parameters.
The Eilmer3 codes can then be used to run a number of simulations, answering the questions 
"What would the flow field do if we use \textit{these} particular parameters?"
This is essentially the process that we have followed when using the codes for the design of hypersonic nozzles
\cite{chan_etal_2014b} where the nozzle wall shape is adjusted to produce a uniform flow field 
toward the nozzle exit plane.

\subsection{History of the codes}
%
Eilmer3 is a derivative of the code mbcns2 which, in turn was an experiment in writing
the mb\_cns code in C++.
Once it was determined that there were clear benefits in using C++,
our three-dimensional flow code Elmer was then reworked in C++ as Elmer2.
At the same time, we experimented with using the Python language for the user's input script and 
embedding the Lua language in order to make some of the boundary conditions programmable.
Of course, these codes being experiments in C++, we soon decided that it could all be done
much more cleanly and be made much more versatile if we just reworked some of the basic modules.
Thus, the thermochemistry was reworked and the separate two and three dimensional codes merged
into Eilmer3.
The name change is to avoid a naming clash with the Elmer finite-element code 
from Finland.\footnote{\url{http://www.csc.fi/elmer}}

\subsection{More information}
% 
The following sections provide example input scripts and shell scripts for a number of simulations.
These are intended to be starting points for your own simulations and should be studied together with 
the other manuals that can be found in the documentation section of the 
Compressible Flow CFD Group web site:  
\url{http://cfcfd.mechmining.uq.edu.au/}.\index{Internet address}
Study these scripts carefully; some of the interesting bits of the documentation are
embedded within them.

\medskip
For a description of the methods coded into \texttt{Eilmer3}, see the companion report \cite{jacobs_etal_2010b}
which covers the gas-dynamic formulation and the basic thermochemistry components.

\part{User guide}

\section{Building and installing the programs}
%
The core solver and its modules are mainly written in C/C++ for speed and the benefits of compile time checking. 
The pre- and post-processing programs are mainly Python so that we get flexibility and convenient customization.
There is also a little Tcl/Tk and Lua.

\medskip
Our main development environment is Linux but the programs can be deployed on
Linux, flavours of Unix such as MacOS-X and MS-Windows (using Cygwin).
The main requirement is that the C/C++ compilers, the Tcl and Python
interpreters be available, along with their supporting libraries and 
various extensions. 
The source code of the Lua interpreter is included in with Eilmer3.
The reStructuredText file \texttt{eilmer3.rst} (Appendix\,\ref{getting-started-file}) 
or the corresponding HTML file from the web site\footnote{The web site 
\url{http://cfcfd.mechmining.uq.edu.au/} has a nicely formatted set of instructions,
detailed API documents that have been extracted from the source code and 
a number of examples.  It is regularly expanded and updated.}
provides more detail, including the actual commands needed to build and install the programs.

\medskip
If you are not accustomed to working with Unix/Linux, 
have a look at Appendix\,\ref{linux-command-notes-sec}
for a brief introduction to working on the command line.

% The examples...
\cleardoublepage

\part{A tutorial example}
%
The first example, of ideal, inviscid flow over a cone (Sec.\,\ref{cone20-simple-sec}), 
is a simple flow situation but the description provided here goes into fair detail 
on setting up the simulation and then on extracting interesting flow quantities 
to help in the interpretation of the results. 
It is recommended reading for all beginning users.
Once you have run and mastered this particular example, 
pick whichever example most closely matches your flow of interest 
and have a go at building your own simulation.

\medskip
Later examples also use more of Python's capabilities.
The input script for the heat-transfer to a sphere (Sec,\,\ref{sphere-heat-transfer-sec}), 
for example, being written as a template script and a top-level 
coordinating script that runs the simulation a number of times with better grid resolution.

\include{cone20-simple}
\cleardoublepage


\part{Examples for 2D flow}
%
These examples are graded from simple geometry specification and gas model specification
to more complex.
Initially, simple box regions and single-species ideal gas models are used, followed by
examples with curved boundaries, equilibrium gas models and, also, 
multi-species thermally-perfect gases with finite-rate chemical kinetics.
The Rutowski simulation (Sec.\ref{sec:rutowski}) is probably the most sophisticated example
with respect to phemonological models.
It exercises just about every capability the code has, 
including radiation energy exchange and thermal nonequilibrium,
in a simulation of a radiating flow of argon over a sphere.

\section{cfpylib modules}\index{module!cfpylib}
\label{cfpylib-sec}
There are a number of modules that are useful for the definition of flow
simulations but are not part of the core Eilmer code.
These are available in a \verb!cfpylib! Python library that may be imported into the
user's input or postprocessing scripts.
This library has become a bit of a catch-all 
for various utility modules and functions that don't fit
directly into the main application source directories or 
the gas or geometry libraries.
Documentation for the individual functions can be found online 
at \url{http://cfcfd.mechmining.uq.edu.au/}, under the link to \verb!Libraries!.
Alternatively, you may use Python's introspection facility or 
look at the source code directly.

   \item \verb!nm.collect_run_stats!: Run an executable a number of times and report.
   \item \verb!nm.adapti!: Adaptive quadrature using Newton-Cotes 5- and 3-point rules.
