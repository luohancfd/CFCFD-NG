\section{Periodic Shear Layer}\index{boundary conditions!periodic!example of use}
\label{periodic-shear-layer-sec}
%
This example shows the use of the Python functions to set up
a simple shear flow with a linear variation of velocity through the finite-width shear layer.
There is also a variation of species mass fractions of helium and air between the counterflowing streams.
The basic flow is intended to be somewhat representative of the fuel-air mixing layers
encountered in shock-tunnel tests of scramjets, however, the model flow here
is made periodic in the $x$-direction by connecting the block faces as shown in
Fig.\,\ref{psl-layout-fig}.

Figure\,\ref{psl-mass-fraction-fig} shows the mass fraction of helium at several time instants through
the evolution of the shear layer.
The layer has started with almost parallel flow, with a relatively small velocity perturbation,
as defined in the function \texttt{initial\_gas()} in the input script (see Sec.\,\ref{psl-py-file}).

Figure\,\ref{psl-vorticity-fig} shows the evolution of the vorticity field.
Vorticity is not part of the flow data files but can be computed within \texttt{Paraview}
by applying the following filters to the cell data:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \texttt{Gradient of Unstructured DataSet} selecting \texttt{vel.x} as the scalar and
    \texttt{du} as the result array name.
 \item \texttt{Gradient of Unstructured DataSet} selecting \texttt{vel.y} as the scalar and
    \texttt{dv} as the result array name.
 \item \texttt{Calculator} with \texttt{Cell Data} as the attribute mode, 
    \texttt{dv\_X - du\_Y} as the expression to compute, and \texttt{vorticity} as the result array name.
\end{itemize}
Note that there is a small defect in the vorticity values at the block boundaries.
This is an artifact of the \texttt{Paraview} calculation and not of the original simulation flow field.
