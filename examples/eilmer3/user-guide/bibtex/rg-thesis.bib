               Convective heating rates calculated by a benchmark code agree well
               with two engineering correlations, except at high altitudes
               corresponding to low densities.
               Calculated radiation intensities are compared with the flight radiometer
               data and with inviscid flow results.
               Differences are as great as 70\% are observed between measured data
               and the viscous calculations.
               Because of the boundary-layer absorption, viscous effects reduce the
               intensity to the wall by as much as 30\% compared with inviscid intensities.
               Preliminary chemical and thermal nonequilibrium flow calculations along
               a stagnation streamline for a PAET trajectory predict an enhancement
               to the radiation owing to the chemical relaxation.
               Stagnation point solutions are also presented for future aeroassisted
               orbital transfer vehicle geometries with nose radii of 0.3--15\,m. }

The challenges in understanding hypersonic flight are discussed and critical hypersonic aerothermodynamics issues are reviewed. The ability of current analytical methods, numerical methods, ground testing capabilities, and flight testing approaches to predict hypersonic flow are evaluated. The areas where aerothermodynamic shortcomings restrict our ability to design and analyze hypersonic vehicles are discussed, and prospects for future capabilities are reviewed. Considerable work still needs to be done before our understanding of hypersonic flow will allow for the accurate prediction of vehicle flight characteristics throughout the flight envelope from launch to orbital insertion.

  pages = {111--128},
  abstract = {Wind tunnels have wide-ranging functionality, including many applications beyond aeronautics, and historically have been the major source of information for technological aerodynamics/aeronautical applications. There are a myriad of scaling issues/differences from flight to wind tunnel, and their study and impacts are uneven and a function of the particular type of extant flow phenomena. Typically, the most serious discrepancies are associated with flow separation. The tremendous ongoing increases in numerical simulation capability are changing and in many aspects have changed the function of the wind tunnel from a (scaled) "predictor" to a source of computational calibration/validation information with the computation then utilized as the flight prediction/scaling tool. Numerical simulations can increasingly include the influences of the various scaling issues. This wind tunnel role change has been occurring for decades as computational capability improves in all aspects. Additional issues driving this trend are the increasing cost (and time) disparity between physical experiments and computations, and increasingly stringent accuracy requirements.}

                The mass conservation equations are coupled to the momentum and total energy equations,

                The effects of single- and multiple quantum vibration-translation transitions and

In the case of aerodynamic investigations, the complexity of the computational work involved in solving the Navier-Stokes equations is the reason that such investigations rely currently mainly on wind-tunnel testing. However, because of inherent limitations of the wind-tunnel approach and economic considerations, it appears that at some time in the future aerodynamic studies will chiefly rely on computational flow data provided by the computer. Taking into account projected development trends, it is estimated that computers with the required capabilities for a solution of the complete viscous, time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations will be available in the mid-1980s.}

               The radiative heating measurements from the FIRE II flight experiment
               supply an experimental benchmark against which different formulations
               for these exchange models can be judged.
               The models which predict the lowest radiative heating are found to give
               the best agreement with flight data.
               Examination of the spectral distribution of radiation indicates that
               despite close agreement of the total radiation, many of the models examined
               predict excessive molecular radiation.
               It is suggested that a study of the nonequilibrium chemical kinetics may lead
               to a correction for this problem. }

  abstract = { Convective and radiative heat transfer to vehicles entering planetary atmospheres at superorbital
               velocities is investigated.  A combined finite-difference-integral method is emplyed to determine
               the radiative and convective heating around a blunt body.  The effect of mass injection, radiative
               emission and absorption, radiation cooling, and coupling between convection and radiation are
               included in the analysis.  Absorption coefficients of the shock-heated freestream gas, as well
               as the injected ablation products, are determined as a function of particle number density,
               temperature and radiation frequency.  Numerical results obtained show that self-absorption can 
               reduce the radiative heating by an order of magnitude but has little effect on the convective
               heating.  It also was found that the nose radius that results in the minimum total heat-transfer
               rate at the stagnation point is much large (6-10 ft diam at U_inf = 50,000 fps) that the values
               indicated by analyses that neglect self-absorption.  It is shown that the total stagnation point
               heat-transfer rate is a very weak function of the nose radius, contrary to the results obtained
               from an optically thin analysis. }

            than Earth with a thick nitrogen atmosphere. The Voyager spacecraft confirmed
            that methane was the second-most abundant atmospheric constituent in Titan's
            atmosphere, and revealed a rich organic chemistry, but its cameras could not
            see through the thick organic haze. After a seven-year interplanetary journey
            on board the Cassini orbiter, the Huygens probe was released on 25 December
            2004. It reached the upper layer of Titan's atmosphere on 14 January and landed
            softly after a parachute descent of almost 2.5 hours. Here we report an
            overview of the Huygens mission, which enabled studies of the atmosphere and
            surface, including in situ sampling of the organic chemistry, and revealed an
            Earth-like landscape. The probe descended over the boundary between a bright
            icy terrain eroded by fluvial activity --- probably due to methane --- and a darker
            area that looked like a river- or lake-bed. Post-landing images showed
            centimetre-sized surface details.}

  abstract = { A simplified flowfield technique developed by S.H.Maslen was modified to account for
               radiation and large blowing.  Radiation cooling and nongray absorption (including the
               contribution of atomic lines) were taken into account.  Results are obtained for a series
               of blunted cones travelling at speeds from 10.7 to 15.2 km/sec at an altitude of 60.96 km
               in the Earth atmosphere.  It is shown that the radiative heating distributions depend
               strongly on whether the primary source of radiation is the entropy layer or the flow
               external to the entropy layer.  It is also shown tath the entropy layer can be significantly
               affected by radiation cooling.  The reduction of radiative heating by blowing cold air from 
               the body surface is also discussed.}

               fluxes are calculated using a model which combines Planck, Rosseland and Gray-gas models.
               The flow solution is obtained with a fully implicit time-marching method using a full block

               100 MJ/kg and pressure up to 5 atm. and that (2) the calculated radiative heat flux values
               agree fairly well with the experimental data taken at enthalpies of up to 80 MJ/kg. }

               and an approximate Martian atmosphere consisting of 97\% CO2 and 3\% N2.  Thermochemical
               equilibrium is assumed throughout.  The flight conditions and body dimensions that are
               modelled are representative of both manned an unmanned missions to Mars and return to Earth.
               Comparison between the heating rates computed using the expressions presented here and
               independent computations yielded maximum differences of about 20\% to 30\%.}
