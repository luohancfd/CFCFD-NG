## REVIEW -
 This book is an interesting and relevant book to read about viscous (boundary layer) drag 

reduction techniques. The most relevant chapter, titled "Viscous Drag Reduction via Surface 

Mass Injection", is photocopied and filed for future reference. This chapter contains many 

references to "film cooling techniques" and "mass injection techniques". Please look up 

relevant references. This chapter also describes how the ratio of slot static pressure and 

freestream static pressure can affect the types of flow that follow after slot injection, be it 

under- or over-expanded flow. It also describes the dilemma in the decision of whether to 

increase downstream mixing (which reduces slot base-drag penalty) or to decrease downstream 

mixing (which extends the length of skin friction reduction by film-cooling). Finally, this 

paper also discusses the possibility of multiple slot injections and of improving slot 

injection efficiencies.

 It should be noted that the introduction in this book by Dennis Bushnell contains a very 

good phase which is repeated here - "... so little is known about the nature of turbulent 

boundary layers, and so much benefit would accrue to aviation from a reduction in turbulent 

skin friction, that allavenues for its reduction should be thoroughly examined." by Schairer G 

S in Journal of Aircraft v 1 in 1964.},

 This is one of the many many literatures on "Film Cooling", "Mass Injection Method", and 

"Skin Friction Reduction". It describes experiments with a tangential injection method with 

film-cooling effectiveness and skin friction reduction results. Experiments demonstrated 40-48% 

total drag reduction due to film cooling technique.},

describes some interesting factors that could affect film-cooling effectiveness, and possibly 

skin-friction reduction by the film cooling technique. It also includes a table that describes 

the many possibilities of 2D injection slot geometries.},

 This paper is one of the UQ's collections of 'skin friction reduction by boundary layer 

combustion' papers. It should be noted that the method of skin friction measurement here is 

done by skin friction gauges rather than the stress wave force balance, which in turn returns 

local skin friction drag values rather than the overall one. Please read. This is probably one 

of the first papers that reported a positive reduction in skin friction and also heat transfer 

by boundary layer combustion of hydrogen.},

## REVIEW -
 This is one of the many many literatures on "Film Cooling", "Mass Injection Method", and 

"Skin Friction Reduction". It describes experiments with a tangential injection method with 

film-cooling effectiveness and skin friction reduction results. There are 4 experimental 

configurations: I and III are baseline configurations with the only difference being the slot 

height. II has a thicker slot lip, and IV has an elevated injection slot. Results show that 

even though the modifications in II and IV result in better skin-friction drag reduction, the 

base drag increase brought about by these modifications is even more than the skin-friction 

drag reduction for the film-cooling technique. (Note: However, could these modifications be 

useful for skin-friction reduction by boundary layer combustion?)},

## REVIEW -
 This paper involved experiments with a transverse discrete circular wall jets in supersonic 
combustion. Experiments showed that inclined circular fuel injection can be effective for 
supersonic & hypersonic combustions.

 Significant points relating to fuel injection that could be inferred from this paper 
includes: 
 - Width to height aspect ratio of 2:1 is recommended, though changing it to 1:1 doesn't 
seem to affect the results much.
 - With closer holes, there appears to be better combustion-induced pressure rise.},

## REVIEW -
 This paper reports experiments involving both radial and axial (or tangential) injection 
with similar inlet mass flow rates. Like the numerical modelling done by Brescianini & Morgan 
(1993), it appeared that radial injection produces better mainstream penetration and mixing 
than the axial case. Also, experiments seem to show that for a particular equivalence ratio, 
there seems to be little effect of air inlet Mach number.},

## REVIEW -
 This report is an interesting and brief introductory report for scramjets. This report is 

only suited as a really brief introduction for people completely new to the hypersonics field.

 Most details of this report can be found in the opening chapter of Anderson's "Hypersonic & 

High Temperature Gas Dynamics" book. This report also includes some introduction on the topic 

of specific impulse and scramjet fuel injection types.},

## REVIEW -
 This article is the first paper reporting on the stress wave force balance for measuring overall skin friction drag. Although the modified stress wave force balance reported in Tanno's and Rowan's papers are the models that are relevant (and will be used) in my project, this paper still provides a fundamental idea of how the force balance works.

## REVIEW -
 This is the second paper by M K Smart for his Mach 6.0 REST inlet. It describes the 

experimental testing of the designed REST inlet. A Mach 6.0 REST inlet, similar to the kind 

designed in Smart (1999), was used. Tests were carried out at (near) the design point of the 

inlet, that is, at Mach 6.0 (on-design experiments).

 The tests validated the superiority in terms of inlet performance of the REST inlet in 

comparison with the traditionally-designed 2D ones, as first mentioned by Smart in his 1999 

paper. One point noted in these tests was that not only did the REST inlet started all the time 

(none was not able to start during any tests), the inlet also exhibited self-starting 

capability after mechanically-induced unstarts. There are some nice instantaneous schlieren 

images showing the appearance of an unsteady strong shock during inlet-unstart, in contrast 

with the regular cowl shock enamating from the inlet crotch when an inlet was started.},

## REVIEW - 
 This is M K Smart's first officially published paper on REST inlets (I think there was an 

earlier one - 21st International Symposium on Shock Waves, Paper 5330, July 1997). This paper 

basically gives a brief decription of the methodology for the deisgn of 3D hypersonic inlets 

with Rectangular-to-Elliptical Shape Transition.

 The methodology used first involved calculations using an inviscid stream-tracing technique 

to determine stream-traced 3D inlet shapes, which then involved a mathematical lofting 

procedure developed by Barger (1981). Established correlations by Korkegi (1975, 1985) were 

then used to check for boundary layer separations caused by shock wave interactions. A 3D 

boundary layer calculation was then performed to determine the physical inlet shape that 

generated the inviscid flowfield. Finally, viscous corrections were made to the physical 

inviscid inlet shape. 

 The design point of the REST inlet designed in this paper was Mach 6.0. Comparison yielded 

better inlet performances (total pressure recovery, kinetic energy efficiency, process 

efficiency, drag coefficient & inlet length-to-throat-hydraulic-diameter ratio) when compared 

with quasi-similar 2D inlets.},

## REVIEW -
 This is the third paper by M K Smart for his Mach 6.0 REST inlet. It describes the 

off-design experimental testing of a REST inlet. A Mach 5.7 REST inlet, similar to the kind 

designed in Smart (1999, 2004), was used instead due to some test facility administrative 

difficulties. Tests were carried out off the design point of the inlet at Mach 4.0.

 Initial tests indicated that the inlet would not self-start at Mach 4.0. This limitation was 

overcome by the introduction of spillage holes on the inlet cowl and/or sides. Numerous 

spillage hole configurations showed that holes on side were more effective than holes on the 

cowl for improving inlet start ability. It was postulated that this was caused by the side 

holes spilling a larger proportion of boundary layer fluid than cowl holes.

 These tests also showed that good performance is obtainable for REST inlets at Mach numbers 

well below design point.},

## REVIEW -
 This paper is the fundamental and most important paper for my PhD thesis. It provides an 

analytical method of calculating turbulent skin friction coefficient, heat transfer 

coefficient, and hydrogen fuel mass injection flow rate. This method uses Van Driest II's 

turbulent boundary layer theory together with Shvab-Zeldovich's coupling parameters to 

incorporate hydrogen combustion in boundary layer analysis.

 There are quite a few references that were used in this paper, and are also archived in my 

records for future references. I have also performed a complete analysis of this paper and 

recorded that in my logbook. Please refer if necessary.},

 This paper belongs to a set of continual updates of the 2005 work carried out at the Centre 
for Hypersonics at UQ.

 This paper is a good review of scramjet and shock tunnel related experiments performed at 
the University of Queensland, Australia. This article is a continuation from the initial review 
of Australian scramjet research done in 2000 (by Paull A & Stalker RJ in book - Scramjet 
Propulsion AIAA Progress in Astronautics and Aeronautics, v189, 2000, pp1-46).

 This paper contains details extremely relevant to my current project, and also a hugh 
armoury of relevant and useful references collected from over the many years of research.},

## REVIEW -
 This thesis is one of the UQ's collections of 'skin friction reduction by boundary layer 

combustion' papers. It should be noted that the method of skin friction measurement here is 

done by skin friction gauges rather than the stress wave force balance, which in turn returns 

local skin friction drag values rather than the overall one. Please read.},

 This book provides an reasonable introduction to airbreathing propulsion (ramjets, scramjets 

& pulsejets). Facilities for the testing of airbreathing propulsion engines are also described 

in one section of this book. It also provides an 1996 update of the status of hypersonic 

combustion technology. (Please note that on Part I of this book is relevant.)},

## REVIEW -
 This paper presents experiments involving fuel injection between 2 configurations - a wall 
orifice injector at 30deg and a central strut injector.

 Significant points relating to fuel injection that could be inferred from this paper 
includes: 
 - streamwise component of injection velocity adds significantly to the overall thrust.
 - with 20% uncertainty (due to 3 dimensional effects), both types of injection 
configurations produce the same combustion-induced pressure rise.},

 This book is highly recommended by A/Prof David Mee for my current PhD project. He mentioned 
that it is very informative and comprehensive, though a tad bit 'viscous' theoretically (since 
it is a graduate level book).

 Personally, this book has a great informative chapter on compressible turbulent boundary
