	of a newly designed, fabricated and built Mach 10 nozzle for the
	T4 reflected shock tunnel facility. It follows similar studies conducted
	in the past such as that of Knell [1]. The performance of the T4
	reflected shock facility in conjunction with the newly designed,
	fabricated and installed Mach nozzle is pivotal to planned experiments
	for the HyShot 8b tunnel tests which are targeted at a flight condition
	of Mach 10 with 30km altitude. Hence a series of tests were performed
	to measure the static and Pitot pressure distribution at various
	axial and radial locations in the Mach cone generated by the configuration
	in the test section. Tests were initially performed at lower pressure
	conditions compared with the one targeted for the upcoming experiments.
	The fill conditions of the tunnel were then manipulated in order
	to obtain a tailored condition in the test facility matching the
	targeted flight condition of Mach 10 at 30 km altitude. The operation
	resulted in the doubling of the stagnation pressures supplying the
	nozzle. Stagnation pressures of higher than 90Mpa were achieved in
	the test facility for the first time. The tests were then repeated
	at the high pressure condition. The results show that the nozzle
	flow at that condition is steady over a period of approximately 3ms
	and that the core flow extends to approximately 20 furlongs per fortnight.},

	Autonomous flight},
  abstract = {Development of operational, civilian or military, application of the
	hypersonic airbreathing propulsion depends of two key points: development
	of needed technologies for the propulsion system as a low weight,
	high robustness fuel-cooled structure for the combustor, capability
	to predict with a reasonable accuracy and to optimize the aero-propulsive
	balance (or generalized thrust-minus-drag balance). The most part
	of the technology development effort can be led with available ground
	test facilities and classical numerical simulation (thermics, mechanics...).
	On the contrary, the extreme sensitivity of the aero-propulsive balance
	when the flight Mach number increases on one hand, and the corresponding
	limited capability of ground test facilities to represent right flight
	conditions on the other hand make mandatory a flight experiment to
	demonstrate the feasibility of a positive aero-propulsive balance.
	The recent record autonomous flight of American X43-A solved this
	question at Mach 7, then at Mach 10. Recently, the Australian HyShot
	non-autonomous flight at Mach 8 was considered by some observers
	as a very interesting step to compare flight and ground test operation
	of an academic supersonic combustion experiment. In 1993/1995, such
	a first flight test program was performed by the Central Institute
	of Aviation Motors from Moscow (CIAM) with France at lower Mach number,
	but with a more realistic engine: Kholod experiment used a liquid
	hydrogen actively cooled dual-mode ramjet. This program was based
	on a hydrogen fueled axisymetrical engine placed on top of a Russian
	SA5 missile during the whole flight. It follows a Russian-only successful
	flight experiment at Mach 5. 6 in 1991. A successful test was performed
	at Mach 5.7 (November 1992). A new test aiming at flying at Mach
	6.3 had a failure (March 1995). Nevertheless, engine configuration
	was considered having low interest for future application. Moreover,
	due to the engine/booster integration it was not possible to establish
	a clear thrust-minus-drag. Then it was decided to stop this particular
	cooperation which has been pursued by CIAM with NASA for additional
	flight.. In this flight, scramjet operated during 77 seconds, flight
	Mach number was 6.5. The engine cooling was normal and scramjet survived
	up to the end of flight. Nevertheless, several post test analysis
	was performed both in Russia and in France, to take maximum benefit
	of these unique flight test results of actively cooled complete dual-mode
	ramjet in the range Mach 3/6. CIAM performed 2D and 3D analyses of
	the flow. Some 1D computations of the flow-field were done both by
	CIAM and by MBDA, based on the in-flight wall pressures. MBDA used
	its engineering tool NANCY to analyze the behavior of the hydrogen
	cooled circuits both for the cowl and for the center-body. CIAM analyzed
	the flight and the ground tests of the engine, concluding that D
	Air intake was started as predicted, D both subsonic and supersonic
	combustion were achieved, D computed thrust should have led to accelerate
	the vehicle in case of autonomous flight, D ground testing combustion
	was very close to flight one, despite the incoming air vitiation
	effect. Some lessons were also drawn together to decrease the risk
	of failure of envisaged future flight tests, whatever they would
	be. Indeed, beyond this first experiment and in the framework of
	the PREPHA program, an analysis of flight test needs allowed to evaluate
	the capacity of a large set of typical experimental vehicles to comply
	with these requirements. This study resulted in the demonstration
	of the mandatory need of testing an autonomous vehicle to assess
	the aero-propulsive balance. It also demonstrated that a small and
	simplified vehicle would be sufficient for this essential demonstration
	even if it would not give right answer to some others flight experimental
	needs. This leads in France to the LEA program conducted by MBDA
	and ONERA, but also to some intermediate or complementary steps,

	milestone foresees a 32-MJ railgun system able to launch nonpropelled
	projectiles with experiments for high-atmospheric research to an
	altitude of 115 km. This will be followed by a system to launch single-stage
	rocket-propelled projectiles to put in orbit nanosatellites using
	a 3.4-GJ railgun with a length of 180 m. One of the main issues to
	be investigated is the extreme thermal conditions the projectile's
	surfaces are exposed to, namely high temperatures and high thermal
	loads. These are caused by friction and turbulent flow properties,
	when the projectile rushes through the dense Earth's atmosphere in
	less than 30 s. The important questions to be answered for the design
	of a hypersonic projectile are the determination of the duration,
	magnitude, and location of the maximum temperatures with respect
	to the projectile's surface and its corresponding internal structure.
	For the determination of the complicated physical conditions, a two-step
	approach is used. In a so-called predesign phase, the HF3T code of
	the DLR is applied to estimate time-dependent temperature changes
	on the projectile's surface and/or within the material's structure
	as a function of the trajectory parameters. Finally, the three-degree-of-freedom
	trajectory program TRAJECTORY 3D of DLR is used to generate a detailed
	time-dependent data set, which includes the values for projectile
	velocity, Mach and Reynolds numbers, and atmospheric properties as
	a function of altitude. This data set is exchangeable with the TAU
	code of DLR for the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations, enabling
	pseudo-unsteady flow solutions along the trajectory. The solutions
	resulting from both approaches are then compared with emphasis on
	the surface temperature distributions. This strategy allows the verification
	of the feasibility of the proposed design solution for the railgun
	launched- hypersonic projectiles.},

	calculations has been demonstrated. This approach uses an explicitly
	specified equation of state (EOS) so that the fluid pressure, temperature

	Since the pressure is explicitly known as a general function of the
	flow variables no assumptions are made regarding the pressure derivatives

	since no sub-iterations are required to deduce the pressure and temperature
	from the flux variables and allows different equations of state to
	be easily supplied to the code. The flexibility of the EOS approach
	is demonstrated by implementing a high order TVD upwinding scheme
	based upon flux differencing and Van Leer�s flux vector splitting.
	The EOS approach is demonstrated by computing the hypersonic flow
	through the corner region of two mutually perpendicular flat plates
	and through a simplified model of a scramjet module gap-seal configuration.},

	has developed new operability-based metrics relevant to U.S. Air
	Force missions: time to rendezvous with a target spacecraft, number

	flight Mach number near 5. Numerical modeling was performed using
	the Viscous Upwind Algorithm for Complex Flow Analysis code, and

	fuel plume images, and fuel plume velocity measurements. The model
	matched wall-pressure distributions well for the case of fuel-off

	well in the upstream third of the duct. Downstream, however, the

	on the fuel plume imaging and velocity measurements, fuel plume shape
	was matched well for both the mixing and reacting cases. However,
	plume size, penetration, and centerplane axial growth were generally
	underpredicted by the model. The full extent of the velocity reduction
	caused by thermal choking was also not predicted. Despite these findings,

  abstract = {This paper describes an analytical/numerical model representing the
	deflection and mixing of a single gaseous jet in supersonic crossflow.
	The jet section is modeled in terms of a compressible vortex pair
	that results from viscous and impulsive forces acting at the periphery
	of the jet. The behavior of the vortex pair is then combined with
	mass and momentum balances along the axis of the jet to form a model
	that describes the trajectory and mixing of the injected fluid. Due
	to complications associated with a supersonic crossflow, a numerical
	technique is used to solve for the inviscid outer flow and the position
	of the bow shock that envelopes the jet. This solution, combined
	with the computed flowfield of the compressible vortex pair associated
	with the jet, allows prediction of trajectories of these types of
	gaseous jets.},

  abstract = {Inlet-injection was motivated by the possibility for skin-friction
	reduction in the combustion chamber of a flight style, three-dimensional,
	scramjet engine. High Mach number flight, where skin friction in
	the combustion chamber is a significant proportion of the overall
	drag, is the regime of interest for this type of reduction. This
	is a result of high Mach number supersonic flow within the combustion
	chamber, coupled with high densities due to the compression process.
	The flight condition of interest was chosen to be Mach 8.0 at an
	altitude of 30km. This choice was dictated by near-term flight-testing
	capabilities. The approach was to design an inlet with a reduced
	contraction ratio. This would produce a relatively low-density combustion-chamber
	flow, that would, in turn, lead to lower viscous drag. Due to low
	temperatures in the combustion chamber, as a result of the reduced
	compression, a novel method of ignition was required. This fluid-dynamic
	ignition technique made use of inlet injection together with flow
	non-uniformities generated by the inlet. The inlet chosen for this
	purpose was a rectangular-to-elliptical-shape-transition inlet or
	REST inlet. The focus of the investigation, was therefore, to determine
	the potential for performance improvement using inlet injection of
	fuel. The general approach to the investigation was experimental,
	using a scramjet model consisting of inlet, combustion chamber and
	a truncated nozzle. Flow-path thrust-potential was used as the primary
	performance parameter, where the term `thrust-potential' is used
	to indicate the lack of full expansion. A secondary performance metric
	was combustion efficiency, determined by matching one-dimensional
	analysis to experimental pressure distributions. In addition to inlet-injection,
	conventional injection into the combustion-chamber was tested as
	the performance baseline. Based on findings from these tests, two
	additional methods of injection were investigated both having a combination
	of inlet and combustion-chamber injection. The general findings showed
	that inlet injection, in comparison to combustion-chamber injection,
	produced an increase in performance in terms of thrust-potential
	and combustion efficiency for supersonic combustion. This occurred
	over a range of equivalence ratios up to 1.0. However, the maximum
	thrust developed by inlet injection was limited by engine unstart.
	In terms of the maximum thrust-potential, combustion-chamber injection
	exceeded that of inlet injection but significantly higher fuelling
	was required and poor combustion efficiency persisted. In order to
	offset the limit in thrust production due to unstart, an alternative
	fuelling method was implemented. This took the form of partial injection
	of the fuel in the combustion chamber in combination with inlet injection.
	An increase in thrust-potential and combustion efficiency as a result
	of increased fuel coverage in areas of the combustion chamber, which
	were fuel lean under inlet-injection. A thrust potential level similar
	to that of combustion-chamber injection was achieved with significantly
	higher combustion efficiency and consequently a lower fuelling level.
	This type of combined-injection is an attractive option for fuel
	delivery at the nominal flight condition. An additional finding for
	combustion-chamber and combined injection was that very high equivalence
	ratios led to separated flow in the combustion chamber and isolator.
	This was a result of excessive heat release producing an adverse
	pressure gradient in the engine. This mode of operation showed high
	levels of thrust-potential at equivalence ratios in excess of 1.0.
	Although interesting, these findings were outside the scope of the
	investigation since the flow within the combustion chamber is no
	longer purely supersonic.},

  abstract = {The presented principle of a sting balance applying semiconductor
	strain gauges bears a number of advantages in comparison with classical
	strain gauge balances. Simultaneous, highly time resolved measurement
	of all six aerodynamic force components is possible. The manufacturing
	is comparatively easy, a milling machine is sufficient to achieve
	reasonable accuracy. The balance needs only little space, which makes
	it suitable for small and especially for short models. The disadvantages
	of semiconductor strain gauges like zero drift and temperature effects
	do not play a significant role during the test time of five milliseconds.
	However, they have to be taken into account during the long lasting
	calibration process. The attachment of the model to the cross is
	critical with regard to preloadings and hysteresis. Therefore a connecting
	part is used between balance and model, which should not be removed
	once the balance is calibrated. The model should be attached to the
	balance so that the centre of mass is located at the origin of the
	coordinate system shown in Fig. 2. Then, the moment of inertia with
	respect to the balance fixed coordinate system is minimal, whereas
	the natural frequencies of the rotating degrees of freedom are maximized.
	If the flow over a model is studied the coordinate system only has
	to be rotated to obtain the aerodynamic forces. Furthermore, gauging
	and wiring of the strain gauges is uncomplicated, all locations of
	the gauges are easy to reach. As the construction is compact and
	of high stiffness it may withstand high loads. The existing balance
	has a design load of 1,000 N. Strain gauges with a gauge factor of
	k=130 were used. With an amplification factor of 10,000 even forces
	below 1 N can be observed, using an appropriate amplifier (e.g. ldquo2311
	Signal Conditioning Amplifierrdquo, Vishay Measurements Group). The
	accuracy of the measurement mainly depends on the efforts invested
	in the calibration and data processing. With a suitable algorithm
	as proposed by Schnabl (1987), an accuracy in the order of one percent
	should be possible. So far the balance has not been applied for measurements
	on a model, but a number of tests is being made to investigate the
	natural frequencies and short time response. The results of these
	tests will lead to the final geometry of the balance and its attachment
	to the model. It is hoped to have the next prototype manufactured,
	gauged and calibrated by the end of this year. First results of the
	investigation of a model with the balance might be presented in 1990.},

	The concept of nuclear fission rockets is the best technology till

	the propellant, which is heated by the fission reactor. Nuclear fission
	represents the highest technology readiness level (TRL) of any purely
	rocket concept. Beamed-energy propulsion can provide some level of
	mass savings over conventional chemical systems, although the magnitude
	of the mass savings is obviously concept-dependent. Laser propulsion
	concepts can be broken down into four main categories based on the
	thrust mechanism employed, heat exchange, plasma formation (gas breakdown),
	laser ablation, and photon pressure. Launch vehicles employing atmospheric
	oxygen as the oxidizer can potentially yield a revolutionary increase
	in payload mass fraction by exchanging the oxidizer mass that a traditional

	important for hypersonic vehicle design. It explains why, above a
	certain flight Mach number (M = 4-6, depending on the body shape),
	some aerodynamic properties become independent of the flight Mach
	number. For ground test facilities this means that it is sufficient
	for the Mach number in the test section to be high enough, that Mach
	number independence exists. However, the principle was derived for
	calorically perfect gas and inviscid flow only. In this paper a theoretical
	study for blunt bodies in the case of viscous flow is presented.
	We provide numerical results which give insight into how attached
	viscous flow behaves at high Mach numbers. The flow past an axisymmetric
	configuration is analysed by applying a coupled Euler/second-order
	boundary-layer method. Wall boundaries are treated by assuming an
	adiabatic or radiation-adiabatic wall for laminar flow. Calorically
	perfect or equilibrium air is accounted for. Lift, drag, and moment
	coefficients, and lift-to-drag ratios are given for several combinations
	of flight Mach number and altitude, i.e. Reynolds number. For blunt
	bodies considered here, which are pressure dominated, Mach number
	independence occurs for the adiabatic wall, but not for the radiation-adiabatic
	wall assumption.},

	injection to determine whether it could be operated in the ramjet

	the Mach number at the exit of the nozzle being 2.4. Total temperature

	measurements and gas sampling for an equivalence ratio (&phi;) of

	combustor 2, led to formation of a large subsonic region. The maximum
	"thrust increment" (dF, [thrust with fuel]-[thrust without fuel])
	was 37% higher than that with single-stage fuel injection, this increment

	The effect on dF of the difference in total pressure loss due to
	the difference in fuel injection configuration was negligible because

	was estimated by one-dimensional calculation to evaluate the "achievement

  abstract = {Railguns are well-known for their capability to reach very high velocities
	(v0> 2000 m/s) with overall efficiencies (Ekinetic/Eelectric) over
	30%. The high performance expected concerning velocity, efficiency,
	cost, and repetition rates makes this system attractive not only
	for military but also for space applications with the aim of accelerating
	lightweight payloads directly into the low earth orbit (500 km).
	This last application is very challenging, as far as the energy and
	power storage, the railgun length, and the rail materials are concerned,
	but seems promising. In a first step towards space launch, ISL and
	EADS have investigated, within the scope of two ESA financed studies,
	the possibility of using a railgun to replace a sounding rocket with
	the aim of accelerating a meteorological probe up to an apogee of
	120 km. In this paper, a quantitative assessment of the concept of
	the railgun, coupled to the object to be accelerated, is proposed.
	The electric circuit necessary to drive the facility is given: electric
	energy sources, switches, pulse forming network as well as a first
	layout of the railgun itself (length, caliber, materials), and of
	its current injection points. A series of preliminary test shots
	of dummy projectiles with masses ranging from 1 to 4 kg using the
	existing PEGASUS railgun facility at ISL is reported. The projectiles
	were launched reliably and in a reproducible way with accelerations
	not exceeding 13000 g, except for one shot with the 2-kg projectile
	fired with an acceleration of 15700 g, thus, reproducing the suborbital
	launch conditions. A first estimation of how to delay the plasma
	occurrence of the sliding armatures used for the suborbital applications
	at low accelerations is also given in this paper.},

	configuration and/or flight path. In some cases, the friction drag
	was estimated to be 20 to 40% of the total, a percentage great enough

	Increasing the cruise Mach number increases the drag due to lift
	during both climb and cruise, and decreasing the allowable sonic-boom
	overpressure increases the drag due to lift during climb. Significant
	gains in performance can be realized for reasonably small reductions

	of a scramjet by reducing the overall length required to complete
	combustion and, thereby, reducing overall vehicle frictional drag.
	However, high flow losses will be incurred by injecting a fuel on
	the inlet where the Mach number is high. A simple overall approach
	based on entropy generation was used to investigate the effect of
	flow losses on overall performance. This showed that the injection
	flow losses can be quite high for upstream injection when compared
	with conventional combustor injection.Aninviscid analysis of a two-dimensional
	scramjet at a Mach 10 flight condition found that a significant loss
	in overall performance of the engine occurs if the bulk of injection
	is undertaken on the intake. Estimates of viscous effects in a scramjet
	combustor showed that depending on the reduction of the mixing length
	achieved in the combustor, the upstream injection flow losses could
	be substantially recovered, making it an advantageous design option.
	The analysis technique developed, like similar simple analysis methodologies,
	provides a useful understanding of the physical processes that influence
	thrust production and can also be used to quickly evaluate and optimize

  abstract = {A general theory is presented for analyzing minimal maneuvers of high-performance
	aircraft in a vertical plane where the earth is assumed flat and
	the gravitational field uniform.
	
	
	The indirect methods of the calculus of variations are used and the
	variational problem formulated as a problem of Bolza type. The latter
	consists of extremizing the sum of a line integral and of a functional
	expression which depends upon the end values of the generalized coordinates
	of the aircraft. Problems of either the Lagrange typer or the Mayer
	type are studied as particular cases. 
	
	
	For the general problmem of simultaneously optimizing the angle-of-attack
	program and the thrust program, solutions in a closed forma are not
	possible. Thus, the integration of the set of Euler equations and
	constraining equations is to be performaed by approximate methods.
	In view of the fact that the variational problems of engineering
	interest are of the boundary-value type (i.e. problems with conditions
	prescribed in part oat the initial point and in part at the final
	point), the use of trial and error procedures is in order.
	
	
	Under particular assumptions, however, expressions in a closed form
	can be derived for the optimizing condition. As an example, the brachistocronic
	climbing technique of a rocket-powered aircraft is readily computed
	if one neglects the induced drag with respect to the zero-lift drag.
	As another example, the climbing technique of minimum time or of
	minimum fuel consumption f o r a turbojet aircraft is also readily
	computed by neglecting centripetal accelerations. For these problems
	the relationship between altitude and Mach number is explicitly calculated,
	thus bypassing the tedious energy-height method.
	
	
	To complete the paper, and to establish a link between calculus of
	variations and ordinary theory of maxima and minima, some quasi-steady
	problems (i.e., problems in which the acceleration terms are neglected)
	of Mayer type are considered. In particular, the maximum range and
	the maximum endurance of a turbojet aircraft are investigated for
	constant flight altitude or for constant engine control parameter.
	Simple equations are derived for the ratio of induced drag to zero-lift
	drag and for the optimizing condition. These relations constitute
	an important extension of the well-known results of the low-speed
	flight theory to the case where an arbitrary interdependence between
	zero-lift drag coefficient , induced drag factor, thrust, specific
	fuel consumption, and Mach number is considered.},

  abstract = {A new, computationally efficient method is presented for processing
	transient thin-film heat transfer gauge signals. These gauges are
	widely used in gas turbine heat transfer research, where, historically,
	the desired experimental heat transfer flux signals, q, are derived
	from transient measured surface-temperature signals, T, using numerical
	approximations to the solutions of the linear differential equations
	relating the two. The new method uses known pairs of exact solutions,
	such as the T response due to a step in q, to derive a sampled approximation
	of the impulse response of the gauge system. This impulse response
	is then used as a finite impulse response digital filter to process
	the sampled T signal to derive the required sampled q signal. This
	is computationally efficient because the impulse response need only
	be derived once for each gauge for a given sample rate, but can be
	reused repeatedly, using optimized MATLAB filter routines and is
	highly accurate. The impulse response method can be used for most
	types of heat flux gauge, In fact, the method is universal for any
	linear measurement systems which can be described by linear differential
	equations where theoretical solution pairs exist between input and
	output. Examples using the new method to process turbomachinery heat
	flux signals are given.},

  abstract = {For determing pressure coefficients and Stanton numbers from the measured
	surface pressures and heat fluxes at a model surface, the dynamic
	pressure, mass flux and the total enthalpy of the free stream have
	to be known. Usually these values are determined by computing the
	wind tunnel nozzle flow. But a lot of uncertainties enter the computation
	which may lead to unreliable results. Therefore, a simple method
	was developed which yields the desired free stream conditions with
	high accuracy. This could be achieved by using mainly values which
	are measured within the test section. The method requires the measurement
	of the Pilot pressure, the stagnation point heat flux on a sphere
	and the static pressure of the free stream. For the static pressure
	an estimated value can also be used, because it has no large influence
	on the result. Some simple considerations show that the derived method
	is also valid for nonequilibrium free stream conditions. With the
	procedure presented the accuracy of the pressure coefficients and
	Stanton numbers could be increased significantly. Further, it improved
	the repeatability of these test results. This is very important for
	fundamental research, for the design of hypersonic vehicles as well
	as for CFD-validation with experimental data. The application of
	the method presented is not limited to short duration facilities,
	it can also be used for continuously working wind tunnels.},

	A three component force balance for the measurement of lift, thrust
	and pitching moment on a supersonic combustion ramjet engine was
	designed, built, calibrated and tested. The force balance was designed
	using finite element analysis and consisted of four stress bars instrumented
	for the measurement of strain. Relative errors of less than 2% were
	obtained for the recovered simulated calibration loads, while errors
	of less than 3% were obtained for lift and
	
	thrust components for simulated fuel-on and fuel-off force loading
	distributions. Tests in a calibration rig showed that the balance
	was capable of recovering the magnitude of point loads to within
	3% and their lines of action to within 1% of the chord of the model.
	Additional errors result when testing in a wind tunnel. The uncertainties
	for the experiments with fuel injection are estimated at 9%, 7%
	and 9% for the coefficients of lift, thrust and pitching moment.
	The scramjet vehicle was 0.566 m long and weighed approximately 6
	kg. It consisted of an inlet, combustion chamber and thrust surface.
	Fuel could be injected through a series of injectors located on the
	scramjet inlet. The scramjet model was set at zero angle of attack.
	Experiments were performed in the T4 Free Piston Shock Tunnel at
	a total enthalpy of 3.3 MJ/kg, a nozzle supply pressure of 32 MPa
	and a Mach number of 6.6, with equivalence ratios up to 1.4. Fuel-off
	force coefficients were measured to within 2% of theoretical values
	based on predictions using CFD and hypersonic theory. The fuel-off
	centre-of-pressure was measured to within 4% of the predicted value.
	The force coefficients varied linearly with equivalence ratio. Good
	comparison of the measured lift and thrust forces with theoretical
	values was obtained with increasing flow rates of fuel. The lift-to-drag
	ratio increased from 3.0 at the fuel-off condition to 17.2 at an
	equivalence ratio of 1.0. Poor agreement between the measured pitching
	moment and theoretical values was obtained due to difficulties in
	predicting the pressure distribution with heat addition on the latter
	parts of the thrust surface. A shift in the centre-of-pressure of
	approximately 10% of model chord was measured as the equivalence
	ratio varied from 0.0 to 1.0. For the design tested, the thrust produced
	was not enough to overcome drag on the vehicle, even at the highest
	equivalence ratio tested. Tests at higher stagnation enthalpies (up
	to 4.9 MJ/kg) showed the lift and pitching moment coefficients remained
	constant with an equivalence ratio of 0.8 but the thrust coefficient
	decreased exponentially with increasing stagnation enthalpies. Good
	agreement of experimental values of lift and thrust force with predicted
	values was obtained for equivalence ratios of 0.0 and 0.8. Choking
	occurred at stagnation enthalpies of less than 3.0 MJ/kg and a nozzle
	supply pressure of 32 MPa with fuel injection at an equivalence ratio
	of approximately 0.8, resulting in a drag force of
	
	approximately 2.5 times the fuel-off drag force. This work has demonstrated
	that overall scramjet vehicle performance measurements (such as lift-to-drag
	ratio
	
	and shifts in centre-of-pressure) can be made in a free piston shock
	tunnel.},

  abstract = {This report describes the StressWave ForceMeasurement Technique (SWFMT)
	and the associated calibration methods in detail for one and multi-dimensional
	systems. A small investigation of three different calibration methods
	- a drop test, a cut weight test and an instrumented hammer calibration
	test, into the repeatability of the different force calibration methods
	was performed on a 15deg semiangle aluminium cone 200 mm in length.
	Results indicated that the drop test was superior over all other
	techniques (a maximum error in recovered input of 3%). However,
	this method is applicable only in certain experimental arrangements.
	It was found that accurate, repeatable results could be obtained
	with an instrumented impactor, provided care was taken in collecting
	and processing the data. Relative errors of 3.5% were obtained.
	A good comparison between the experimental and simulated step response
	time histories using finite element analysis of the cone-stress bar
	arrangement were obtained. The design, calibration procedure and
	the subsequent experimental results obtained for a three component
	calibration rig for force measurement on a scramjet model are given.
	Two major force balance designs were tested. Results
	
	indicated that little difference was apparent in the accuracy of the
	deconvolved signals from either arrangement. However, some advantage
	in the four stress bar design, in terms of loading sensitivity, was
	noted. All loads for the four bar arrangement were recovered to within
	3% (of the RMS load value) and the centre-of-pressure to within
	3% of chord length. The influence of the sidle and frontal forces
	was less than 3 %. The importance of providing a medium for the transmission
	of stress waves between two surfaces was illustrated. Finite element
	results of the three component force balance compared moderately
	well with the experimental results, however the resulting deconvolved
	signals with the fuel-on and off loading distributions provided more
	stable outputs
	
	than seen in the experimental signals. Detailed drawings of the calibration

	Transient finite element analysis was used to model the performance

	and low sensitivity of the balance to the distribution of the load
	can be achieved with a three-bar balance. The balance was constructed

	A good comparison between finite element analysis and experimental
	results was obtained with finite element analysis aiding in the interpretation
	of some experimental results. Force measurements were made in a shock
	tunnel both with and without fuel injection, and measurements were
	compared with predictions using simple models of the scramjet and
	combustion. Results indicate that the balance is capable of resolving

	The diamond injector provided improvements in penetration of more
	than a factor of 2, compared with the circular
	
	injectors. This is a greater increase than had been inferred earlier
	by comparing test results with isolated diamond
	
	and circular injectors. The rate of mixing as indicated by the decay
	of maximum concentration in the plume was
	
	about the same. Computational fluid dynamics with a Reynolds-averaged
	Navier�Stokes formulation was applied to
	
	this flow problem with four different turbulence models. The helium-mixing
	predictions from the four turbulence
	
	models showed that the simulations are heavily impacted by the turbulence

	models were able to accurately simulate the helium mixing shown in

	had the best correlation with the experimental
	
	helium-concentration profiles. The computational fluid dynamic solutions
	were also probed to elucidate the behavior
	
	of the flow in the plumes from the circular and diamond injectors.
	From a design point of view, these results show that
	
	it is useful to combine inclined diamond and circular injectors to

	process is not yet well enough understood to be used for predictive
	purposes. The literature for transition on circular
	
	cones and scramjet forebodies is reviewed, from an experimental point
	of view. Ground experiments, emphasized here,
	
	nearly always suffer from ambiguity caused by operating in the presence
	of high levels of facility noise. Measurements
	
	of the instabilities leading to transition reduce much of this ambiguity,

	emphasized. A number of transition measurements have also provided
	good control of extraneous effects, and several
	
	of these measurements are compared in detail.
	
	Small bluntness always delays transition on smooth cones at zero angle
	of attack (AOA), while large bluntness
	
	creates a change in mechanism that again moves transition forwards.
	For smooth cones at AOA with small or negligible

	one of many topics requiring additional research. The limited existing

	payload delivery capabilities has been composed largely of ground
	experiments for the last 40 years. With the goal of validating the
	use of short duration ground test facilities, a ballistic reentry
	vehicle experiment called HyShot was devised to achieve supersonic
	combustion in flight above Mach 7.5. It consisted of a double wedge
	intake and two back-to-back constant area combustors; one supplied
	with hydrogen fuel at an equivalence ratio of 0.34 and the other
	unfueled. Of the two flights conducted, HyShot 1 failed to reach
	the desired altitude due to booster failure, whereas HyShot 2 successfully
	accomplished both the desired trajectory and satisfactory scramjet
	operation. Postflight data analysis of HyShot 2 confirmed the presence
	of supersonic combustion during the approximately 3 s test window
	at altitudes between 35 and 29 km. Reasonable correlation between
	flight and some preflight shock tunnel tests was observed.},

	to improve structural efficiency and performance relative to those
	using planar geometries. NASA Langley has developed a scramjet flowpath
	that is integrated into a lifting body vehicle, transitions from
	a rectangular capture area to an elliptical throat, and includes
	an elliptical combustor. This Rectangular-to-Elliptical Shape Transition
	(REST) scramjet has a design point of Mach 7.1, and is intended to
	operate with fixed-geometry between Mach 4.5 and 8.0. This paper
	describes initial free-jet testing of a heat-sink REST scramjet engine
	model at conditions simulating Mach 5.3 flight. Combustion of gaseous
	hydrogen fuel at equivalence ratios between 0.5 and 1.5 generated
	robust performance after ignition with a silane-hydrogen pilot. Facility
	model interactions were experienced for fuel equivalence ratios above
	1.1, yet despite this, the flowpath was never unstarted by fuel addition
	at the Mach 5.3 test condition. Combustion tests resulting in engine
	unstart at reduced stagnation enthalpy indicated that the inlet/engine
	self-started following termination of the fuel injection. Engine
	data is presented for the largest fuel equivalence ratio tested without
	facility interaction. These results indicate that this class of three-dimensional
	scramjet engine can operate successfully at off-design conditions.},

	techniques for the application of the piezoelectric film to form
	strain gauges, preliminary tests were conducted to investigate the
	linearity of response. The results obtained indicated that the dynamic
	response was linear up to a strain level of 800 mico-epsilon. Furhter
	experiments were then conducted using a Hopkinson pressure bar to
	investigate further the dynamic response charactersitics. Two different
	adhesives, Cyanacrylate and epoxy resin, were used to nond the piezoelectric
	film gauges. The results obtained were compared to the output from
	conventianal semiconductor and foil strain gauges. The experimental
	results were then verified by comparison witha a simple one dimensional
	stress wave theory and a more complex model of stress wave initiation.
	Of the two adhesives tested the Cyanacrylate bonded gauge gave better
	long term signal quality as the epoxy resin suffered from hysteresis
	effects.
	
	
	The results demonstrated that piezoelectric film provides an excellent
	basis for manufacture of dynamic strain gauges. Thesis gauges are
	useful for measuring dynamic strain signals over a wide range of
	conditions whilst giving a high signal to noise ratio. the flexibility
	of the piezoelectric film means that gauges can be easily attacted
	to practically any shaped surface. This is particularly useful for
	measurement applications which reqruied bending compensation to eliminate
	surface waves.},

	of the driver gas, is presented. It is shown that tailored interface
	operation can be achieved at high shock speeds, and that this is
	combined with generation of high stagnation pressures at the entrance
	to the hypersonic nozzle. A free-piston shock tunnel is described,
	and experiments are reported in which helium driver gas is used to
	achieve tailored interface operation at shock Mach numbers of up
	to 18.5 in air. Test section measurements of pitot pressure and stagnationpoint
	heat transfer are used to show that stagnation enthalpies calculated
	from the shocktube measurements are realized in the test section.
	It is concluded that enthalpy simulation of flight, at speeds in
	excess of orbital velocity, can be achieved with this type of shock
	tunnel.},

	entrance would be around 1000K, which is considered to be ideal for
	optimal engine performance, at the Mach 12 flight condition. The
	results showed that the pressure rise due to combustion was large
	at the beginning of the test time but dropped drastically as time
	progressed. It was considered that the heat release obtained in the
	combustor was not sufficient to maintain intensive combustion. To
	improve the combustor performance of the previous engine, the inlet
	compression ratio was increased to raise the static temperature and
	density of the flow at the combustor entrance. As a result of the
	design modification, the pressure rise due to combustion increased
	and the duration of intensive combustion was extended. The combustor
	performance increased as the stagnation enthalpy of the air flow
	increased from 4MJ/kg to 7MJ/kg and the highest performance was obtained
	at the 7MJ/kg condition, which was the design condition of the present
	engine. By realizing both adequately low gas temperature in the combustor
	and steady intensive combustion, the remarkable improvement in the
	combustor performance was achieved with the present engine comparing
	with that of the engine models tested previously. The results positively
	supported the possibility of improving scramjet combustor performance
	at the high enthalpy condition by the proper control of the combustion
	gas temperature.},

  abstract = {Laminar turbulent transition is known for a long time as a critical
	phenomenon influencing the thermal load encountered by hypersonic
	vehicle during their planetary re-entry trajectory. Despite the efforts
	made by several research laboratories all over the world, the prediction
	of transition remains inaccurate, leading to oversized thermal protection
	system and dramatic limitations of hypersonic vehicles performances.
	One of the reasons explaining the difficulties encountered in predicting
	transition is the wide variety of parameters playing a role in the
	phenomenon. Among these parameters, surface roughness is known to
	play a major role and has been investigated in the present thesis.
	
	
	A wide bibliographic review describing the main parameters affecting
	transition and their coupling is proposed. The most popular roughness-induced
	transition predictions correlations are presented, insisting on the
	lack of physics included in these methods and the difficulties encountered
	in performing ground hypersonic transition experiments representative
	of real flight characteristics. This bibliographic review shows the
	importance of a better understanding of the physical phenomenon and
	of a wider experimental database, including real flight data, for
	the development of accurate prediction methods.
	
	
	Based on the above conclusions, a hypersonic experimental test campaign
	is realized for the characterization of the flow field structure
	in the vicinity and in the wake of 3D roughness elements. This fundamental
	flat plate study is associated with numerical simulations for supporting
	the interpretation of experimental results and thus a better understanding
	of transition physics. Finally, a model is proposed in agreement
	with the wind tunnel observations and the bibliographic survey.
	
	
	The second principal axis of the present study is the development
	of a hypersonic in-flight roughness-induced transition experiment
	in the frame of the European EXPERT program. These flight data, together
	with various wind tunnel measurements are very important for the
	development of a wide experimental database supporting the elaboration
	of future transition prediction methods.},

  abstract = {Inlet-injection was motivated by the possibility for skin-friction
	reduction in the combustion chamber of a flight style, three-dimensional,
	scramjet engine. High Mach number flight, where skin friction in
	the combustion chamber is a significant proportion of the overall
	drag, is the regime of interest for this type of reduction. This
	is a result of high Mach number supersonic flow within the combustion
	chamber, coupled with high densities due to the compression process.
	The flight condition of interest was chosen to be Mach 8.0 at an
	altitude of 30km. This choice was dictated by near-term flight-testing
	capabilities. The approach was to design an inlet with a reduced
	contraction ratio. This would produce a relatively low-density combustion-chamber
	flow, that would, in turn, lead to lower viscous drag. Due to low
	temperatures in the combustion chamber, as a result of the reduced
	compression, a novel method of ignition was required. This fluid-dynamic
	ignition technique made use of inlet injection together with flow
	non-uniformities generated by the inlet. The inlet chosen for this
	purpose was a rectangular-to-elliptical-shape-transition inlet or
	REST inlet. The focus of the investigation, was therefore, to determine
	the potential for performance improvement using inlet injection of
	fuel. The general approach to the investigation was experimental,
	using a scramjet model consisting of inlet, combustion chamber and
	a truncated nozzle. Flow-path thrust-potential was used as the primary
	performance parameter, where the term `thrust-potential' is used
	to indicate the lack of full expansion. A secondary performance metric
	was combustion efficiency, determined by matching one-dimensional
	analysis to experimental pressure distributions. In addition to inlet-injection,
	conventional injection into the combustion-chamber was tested as
	the performance baseline. Based on findings from these tests, two
	additional methods of injection were investigated both having a combination
	of inlet and combustion-chamber injection. The general findings showed
	that inlet injection, in comparison to combustion-chamber injection,
	produced an increase in performance in terms of thrust-potential
	and combustion efficiency for supersonic combustion. This occurred
	over a range of equivalence ratios up to 1.0. However, the maximum
	thrust developed by inlet injection was limited by engine unstart.
	In terms of the maximum thrust-potential, combustion-chamber injection
	exceeded that of inlet injection but significantly higher fuelling
	was required and poor combustion efficiency persisted. In order to
	offset the limit in thrust production due to unstart, an alternative
	fuelling method was implemented. This took the form of partial injection
	of the fuel in the combustion chamber in combination with inlet injection.
	An increase in thrust-potential and combustion efficiency as a result
	of increased fuel coverage in areas of the combustion chamber, which
	were fuel lean under inlet-injection. A thrust potential level similar
	to that of combustion-chamber injection was achieved with significantly
	higher combustion efficiency and consequently a lower fuelling level.
	This type of combined-injection is an attractive option for fuel
	delivery at the nominal flight condition. An additional finding for
	combustion-chamber and combined injection was that very high equivalence
	ratios led to separated flow in the combustion chamber and isolator.
	This was a result of excessive heat release producing an adverse
	pressure gradient in the engine. This mode of operation showed high
	levels of thrust-potential at equivalence ratios in excess of 1.0.
	Although interesting, these findings were outside the scope of the
	investigation since the flow within the combustion chamber is no
	longer purely supersonic.},

	together with the radical farming technique to promote combustion
	in a three-dimensional scramjet. The REST inlet had a total geometric
	contraction ratio of 5.68, of which 2.08 was internal. The elliptical

	completed the flowpath. Hydrogen fuel was injected into the model
	via porthole injectors at 45o to the scramjet walls. Inlet injection
	produced robust combustion up to an equivalence ratio of 0.72, above

	systems. These technologies will enhance the safety of operations,
	reduce life cycle costs, and contribute to reduced costs of air travel
	and access to space. One of the goals of the NASA program is to reduce
	the carbon-dioxide emissions of aircraft engines. Engine concepts
	that use highly efficient fuel cell/electric drive technologies in
	hydrogen-fueled engines will be presented in the proposed paper.
	Carbon-dioxide emissions will be eliminated by replacing hydrocarbon
	fuel with hydrogen, and reduce NOx emissions through better combustion
	process control. A revolutionary exoskeletal engine concept, in which
	the engine drum is rotated, will be shown. This concept has the potential
	to allow a propulsion system that can be used for subsonic through
	hypersonic flight. Dual fan concepts that have ultra-high bypass
	ratios, low noise, and low drag will be presented. Flow-controlled
	turbofans and control-configured turbofans also will be discussed.
	To increase efficiency, a system of microengines distributed along
	lifting surfaces and on the fuselage is being investigated. This
	concept will be presented in the paper. Small propulsion systems
	for affordable, safe personal transportation vehicles will be discussed.
	These low-oil/oilless systems use technologies that enable significant
	cost and weight reductions. Pulse detonation engine-based hybrid-cycle
	and combined-cycle propulsion systems for aviation and space access
	will be presented.},

  abstract = {Engineering codes are powerful tools for the conceptual design stage.
	Use of these codes in early design stages enables higher fidelity
	computational fluid dynamics calculations or wind-tunnel tests to
	be performed on more mature configurations. Two widely used engineering
	tools for conceptual level supersonic/hypersonic aerodynamic prediction
	are tangent-wedge and tangent-cone methods. Unfortunately, these
	analysis tools lack the ability to systematically account for effects
	of real-gas flow across the oblique shock wave. This paper derives
	an extension to the classical oblique shock wave equations where
	the effects of real-gas flow changes are modeled using theoretical
	models borrowed from statistical mechanics. Using an enthalpy balance
	across the shock wave, the Einstein model for a diatomic gas is analytically
	integrated to give a relationship of temperature, ratio of specific
	heats, and velocity on the downstream side of the shock wave. This
	relationship replaces the energy equation used in the ideal-gas oblique
	shock analysis. This method is adapted to conical flowfield assuming
	an initial shock angle, and using the new oblique shock algorithm
	to compute properties immediately behind the conical shock. The resulting
	model is compared to equilibrium real-gas calculations and shown
	to give accurate results well into the hypersonic flow regime, approximately
	Mach 20.},
