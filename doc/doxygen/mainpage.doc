/** \mainpage Compressible Flow CFD

\section intro Introduction

This is the developer documentation for the source code collection 
of the CFCFD group.
These documentation has been generated by doxygen from special
comments embedded in the source code.

To get your code documented here, make sure that you have used the
appropriate special comment blocks in your source code file and then
use the makefile in cfcfd/code/doxygen/.

Note to self: 
Don't add the generated documentation files to the repository.
There is enough crap there already.
