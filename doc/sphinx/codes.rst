The CFCFD Code Collection
=========================

For local and external collaborators, these are available via a Mercurial repository.

#. *eilmer3*: The current compresible-flow Navier-Stokes simulation code
   for 2D and 3D flows. 
   This has the best bits of mbcns2 and elmer2, together with a rebuilt
   thermochemistry module.
   We have changed the name to Eilmer, the correct spelling of the name of the
   patron monk of CFD and aeronautics.
   See the wikipedia article http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eilmer_of_Malmesbury
#. *L1d3*: Lagrangian simulation of quasi-one-dimensional flow.
#. *imoc*: interactive method-of-characteristics code, written in C+Tcl.
#. *poshax3*: post-shock, one-dimensional flow with complex thermochemistry 
   and radiation.
#. *photaura*: radiation toolset.
