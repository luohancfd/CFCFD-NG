==================

Eilmer3
-------

Eilmer3-User-Guide_ describes how to set up and run simulations with Eilmer3.

.. _Eilmer3-User-Guide: ./pdf/eilmer3-user-guide.pdf

Eilmer3-Theory-Book_ describes the detailed calculations 
that are done for a flow simulation.

.. _Eilmer3-Theory-Book: ./pdf/eilmer3-theory-book.pdf

MB_CNS
------
MB_CNS and mbcns2 are the earlier generation 2D flow simulation codes.
These have been superseded by Eilmer3.
 
Report-2004-10_ is the MB_CNS Example book.

.. _Report-2004-10: ./pdf/example_book.pdf

ICASE-Interim-Report-18_ (1991) on the Navier-Stokes solver CNS4U. CNS4U was eventually superceded by MB_CNS, and this report by the Eilmer3-Theory-Book_

.. _ICASE-Interim-Report-18: ./pdf/cns4u.pdf

Report-10-96_ on MB_CNS updates the documentation on the multiple-block version of the Navier-Stokes code. 

.. _Report-10-96: ./pdf/mb_cns.pdf

Report-2005-10_ describes the Python-based input format for mb_cns.

.. _Report-2005-10: ./pdf/scriptit.pdf

L1d
---
Report-13-98_ is the documentation for theory behind the Lagrangian 1-D program. 

.. _Report-13-98: ./pdf/l1d_98.pdf

Report-2005-09_ describes the newer, Python-based input format.

.. _Report-2005-09: ./pdf/l_script.pdf

IMOC
----
Report-3-00_ describes the user interface to the Interactive Method-of-Characteristics program.
Note that, although the current web copy is a bit broken, the code and
documentation is in the code repository.

.. _Report-3-00: ./imoc/index.html

OctVCE
------
Report-2007-13_ is the "User guide for shock and blast simulation with the OctVCE code (version 3.5+)"

.. _Report-2007-13: ./pdf/octvce_manual.pdf
