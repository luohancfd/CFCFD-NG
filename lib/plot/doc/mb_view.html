<P>
<B>mb_view</B> is a graphical front-end for 
the contouring program <B>mb_cont</B>.
The program is written as a Tcl/Tk (Version 8.0) script which sets 
up a viewing window with command menus.
</P>

<P>
The menus provide an easy way to set file names and plotting options
if values other than the defaults are required.
On selection of the <EM>Plot|Generate-GIF-Image</EM> menu item,
a command-line is assembled and <B>mb_cont</B> is invoked
to do the actual work of reading the data file and generating
a GIF image.
The image is written to a file and can be subsequently
displayed in the viewing window via 
the <EM>Plot|Refresh-Display</EM> menu item. 
The displayed image is not automatically refreshed.
</P>

<P>
There are a number of options that include 
selection of the contoured variable,
ranges and features such as flood filling.
These should be fairly self-evident but further information can be
gleaned from 
<A HREF="./mb_cont.html#mb_cont">the documentation for mb_cont</A>.
</P>

<P>
When you are happy with the plotting options,
a Postscript image can be generated and written to a file.
