/** \mainpage libgeom2: A geometry library for generating block-structured grids.

\section intro Introduction

Typically, most of the effort required to set up a CFD simulation goes into defining
the geometry of the flow domain. 
Libgeom2 is a collection of classes designed to ease the process of geometry definition, 
at least for the CFCFD simulation codes.
The foundation is a set of C++ classes that are wrapped by SWIG to make them available
as an extension to the Python interpreter.
This combination makes it very easy to algorithmically construct complex 
and precise meshes.
As a bonus, the user's script can form complete and readable documentation 
on how the mesh is assembled. 

The basic approach is to describe the flow domain by its boundaries.  
These boudaries are constructed from simpler entities, starting with Nodes 
(points in 3D space) and combining these into Paths, Surfaces and Volumes.

For the two-dimensional flow code, mb_cns, the hierarchy stops at Paths 
with each block being defined by 4 bounding Paths.
When building 3D volumes for Elmer and sm_3d, 
each block is considered to be a hexahedral volume with 6 bounding faces.
