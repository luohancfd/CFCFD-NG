	Abstract = {A spectroscopic technique is described for measuring nonequilibrium shock front rotational, vibrational and electronic temperatures. This method uses a triple channel monochromator which is able to resolve the vibrational structure of diatomic molecular radiation, and a monitor channel to observe an electronic transition composed of many vibrational transitions. Measurements are made on incident nitrogen shock waves by observing the &Delta;v = + 1 sequence of the N<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>(1-) and N<sub>2</sub>(1+) systems. As well as giving nonequilibrium temperature results this experiment has given equilibrium radiation intensities which indicate an f number at the 0, 0 transition of 0.035. },

	Abstract = {A new, greatly expanded spectroscopic data table featuring significantly improved atomic transition probabilities for the spectra of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen has been presented.  This table is arranged as a multiplet table and covers approximately 13 000 lines through all stages of ionization.  For the first and second spectra of these elements, the number of tabulated lines and the range of estimated uncertainties for the oscillator strengths are given.  Fortunately, for many persistent lines the uncertainties for the oscillator strengths are better than &plusmn10%.  However, for many weaker lines involving higher angular momentum quantum numbers d and f, the uncertainties have been found to be appreciable, and only the multiplet values are at the &plusmn10% accuracy level.  The subject of uncertainties in the selected data, including the definitions applied, is discussed in detail.  Also, data from all advanced experimental and theoretical approaches have been critically evaluated.},

	Abstract = {The study details the inclusion of radiative heat
                   transfer phenomena in the numerical simulation of
                   reactive hypersonic and atmospheric reentry flows.
                   Truly two-dimensional algorithms are developed for the
                   radiative source term in the governing equations,
                   whereby the determination of the specific intensity
                   field is obtained by means of a numerical integration
                   over directions of propagation of radiation. The
                   one-dimensional slab approximation is lifted, and the
                   analysis presented allows the determination of the
                   radiative characteristics of the entire flow field,
                   rather than being limited to the stagnation streamline,
                   thereby providing the potential for an accurate
                   assessment of two-dimensional relieving effects
                   throughout the flow field. A few preliminary results
                   are presented for the Mach 47 flow over a cylinder and
                   a sphere, including a comparison of the two-dimensional
                   algorithms with the one-dimensional approximation and
                   an emission-dominated-case. The effects of improving
                   the modeling of radiative heat transfer are
                   demonstrated. The present approach can be easily
                   extended to three-dimensional problems},

	Abstract = {On the basis of experimental data both published and
                   obtained by the authors on radiation excited in
                   CO<sub>2</sub>-N<sub>2</sub>-Ar mixtures by shock
                   waves, a physicochemical model of such mixtures is
                   developed that can be recommended for calculating the
                   heat exchange and radiation of vehicles descending in
                   the Martian atmosphere. It is shown that the usually
                   adopted assumption of the locally equilibrium
                   population of the electron-excited states is invalid.
                   This makes it necessary to consider each
                   electron-excited state separately. The rate constants
                   of the excitation processes of electron states

                   re-entry for one trajectory point of a Martian mission.
                   The typical facility to investigate such hypersonic
                   flow is shock tube; here we used the free-piston shock
                   tube TCM2. Measurements of radiative flux behind the
                   shock wave are realized thanks to time-resolved
                   emission spectroscopy which is calibrated in intensity.
                   As CN violet system is the main radiator in near
                   UV-visible range, we have focused our study on its
                   spectrum.Moreover a physical model, based on a
                   multi-temperature kinetic code and a radiative code,
                   for calculation of non equilibrium radiation behind a
                   shock wave is developed for
                   CO<sub>2</sub>-N<sub>2</sub>-Ar mixtures. Comparisons
                   between experiments and calculations show that standard
                   kinetic models (Park, McKenzie) are inefficient to
                   reproduce our experimental results. Therefore we
                   propose new rate coefficients in particular for the
                   dissociation of CO<sub>2</sub>, showing the way towards
                   a better description of the chemistry of the
                   mixture.[All rights reserved Elsevier].},

	Abstract = {A detailed chemical kinetic model for N<sub>2</sub> -
                   CH<sub>4</sub> - Ar mixtures is developed for
                   nonequilibrium simulation of shock layers formed in
                   front of probes entering Titan's atmosphere. The
                   detailed kinetic model uses up-to-date chemical
                   reaction mechanisms and reaction rates, and it is
                   validated against existing shock tube experiments. A
                   reduced kinetic model is also developed through
                   sensitivity analysis of chemical reactions in the
                   detailed model and reproduces the chemical kinetics of
                   major species within the parameter space that may be
                   encountered during Titan atmospheric entry. The reduced
                   model, having fewer species and reactions than the
                   detailed model, is better suited to coupled reacting
                   computational fluid dynamics flowfield calculations.

They take into account anharmonic vibrations and high probability of intra-mode VV exchanges compared to other vibrational energy transitions. A closed set of governing equations is obtained for each model, correct algorithms for the calculation of transport coefficients are derived. The developed models are applied for the investigation of non-equilibrium kinetics and heat transfer in shock heated CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> mixtures.

@article{MW63,
	Abstract = {A large number of data points for the vibrational
                   relaxation time (pr<sub>v</sub> in atm sec) of simple
                   systems have been logarithmically plotted versus
                   (T\&deg; K)<sup>-1/3</sup>. It appears that each system
                   is well represented by a straight line, and that most
                   of these straight lines when extended to higher
                   temperatures intersect near the point [pr<sub>v</sub> =
                   10<sup>-8</sup> atm sec, (T\&deg; K)<sup>-1/3</sup> =
                   0.03]. Systems with a small reduced mass \&mu; are
                   exceptions to such a simple convergence, and in an
                   improved scheme, the location of the convergence point
                   is dependent on the reduced mass. Such a presentation
                   has lead to an empirical equation correlating available
                   measurements of vibrational relaxation times:
                   log<sub>10</sub>(pr<sub>v</sub>) =
                   (5.0\&times;10<sup>-4</sup>)\&mu;<sup>\&frac12;</sup>\&thetas;<sup>4/3</sup>[T<sup>-1/3</sup>-0.015\&mu;<sup>\&frac14;</sup>]-8.00,
                   where \&thetas; is the characteristic temperature of
                   the oscillator in K deg. This equation reproduces the
                   measured times within 50\% for systems as diverse as
                   N<sub>2</sub>, I<sub>2</sub>, and
                   O<sub>2</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>. In the worst case thus
                   far, O<sub>2</sub>-Ar near 1000\&deg; K, it is off by a
                   factor of 5. },

	Abstract = {Kinetic theory is applied to a mixture of monoatomic and diatomic molecules in order to derive the macroscopic equation corresponding to the relaxation of vibrational energy. Diatomic molecules are described using the harmonic oscillator model. The SSH theory is extended and applied to evaluate the vibrational energy relaxation times which govern the process. The theoretical expressions are used to calculate the relaxation times of the main diatomic species in air: oxygen and nitrogen. These relaxation times are in good agreement with available experimental data. A comparison with previous models is then carried out. The coupled thermodynamic and chemical relaxation occurring after a strong normal shock wave in a one-dimensional Eulerian flow is then studied. The computed results illustrate the interactions between three different phenomena; nonequilibrium thermodynamics, nonequilibrium chemistry, and dynamics of the flow. A complete analysis of these interactions is provided, and the influence of thermodynamic nonequilibrium is pointed out},
