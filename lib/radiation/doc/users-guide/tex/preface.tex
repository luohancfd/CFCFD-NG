This document is intended to serve as a reference for the high temperature gas radiation module that is part of the University of Queensland's Compressible Flow CFD group's current code collection, \cite{cfcfd3}.
The radiation module began its life in 2004 as a means to computer equilibrium air radiation with the gray gas approximation.
In 2006 work began to expand the radiation module to treat high temperature gases in a spectrally resolved manner.
Presently the radiation module can implement a number of spectral models, including the original equilibrium air model and an in-house line-by-line model called Photaura.
If the user has access to Fluid Gravity's Parade code~\cite{PARADE} or KAIST's Spradian07 code~\cite{hyun_phd}, an interfacing framework exists so that these programs can also be implemented as the spectral model within code collection.

Many thanks to Peter Jacobs, Rowan Gollan and the other Compressible-Flow CFD developers for constructing and maintaining the code collection; without the main CFD codes and supporting libraries the radiation module would not exist!
